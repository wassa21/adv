											So do you feel that motion?
											Do you feel yourself
as part of that motion,
											things moving underneath the surface?
											So the language of musical harmony
is an absolutely extraordinary one.
											It's a way of navigating
one's emotional frameworks,
											but without the need
to put things into words,
											and I think that,
as with many other languages,
											it doesn't matter how much
you know about a language.
											It doesn't matter
how many words you can say,
											how many phrases you know.
											What matters is the emotional choices
you make with this language.
											So I encourage us to embrace
this idea as a community,
											which is the thing which in time
may grow us towards
											as opposed to away from our own humanity.

											Thank you. Represent North London.
											And this room —
I mean, this is my family home.
											I grew up in this room
filled with musical instruments,

to invest in my own imagination,
											and so things I created, things I built
were good things to be building
											just because I was making them,
and I think that's such an important idea.
											But this room was
my paradise, essentially,
											and when I came to tour my album,
which is called ""In My Room,""
											I thought I'd try and tour
the room on the road,
											and that's quite a strange idea,

working on for a couple of years,

to be inside the circle.
