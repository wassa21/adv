											Do you remember
these glow-in-the-dark little stars
											which you had on the ceiling
when you were a boy or a girl?
											Yes?
											It is light.
											It is pure light.
											I think I stared at them way too long
											when I was a five-year-old, you know?
											It's so beautiful:
											no energy bill, no maintenance.
											It is there.

											So two years ago, we went back to the lab,
											making it more durable,
more light-emitting,
											with the experts.
											And at the same time,
we got a request from this guy —
											Van Gogh, the famous
Van Gogh Foundation —
											who wanted to celebrate
his 125th anniversary in the Netherlands.
											And they came to me and asked,
											""Can you make a place
where he feels more alive again
											in the Netherlands?""
											And I liked that question a lot,
											so in way,
											we sort of started to connect
these two different worlds.
											This is how my brain works,
											by the way.

											İki yıl önce, bunları daha kalıcı,

bu adamdan talep aldık
											- Van Gogh, meşhur Van Gogh vakfı -
											Hollanda'da 125. yıl dönümünü
kutlamak istediler.
											Bana gelip şunu sordular:
											""Hollanda'da kendisini
tekrar daha canlı hissedeceği
											bir yer yapabilir misin?
											Ve bu soruyu çok beğendim,
											öyle ki,
											bu iki farklı dünyayı
bir nevi bağlamaya başladık.
											Bu arada benim beynim

											cleans it on the nano level —

											And right now, the project
is touring through China,
											actually with the support
of China's central government.
											So the first goal is to create
local clean-air parks,
											and that works already quite well —
											55, 75 percent more clean.
											And at the same time,
											we team up with the NGOs,
											with the governors,
											with the students,
											with the tech people,
											to say, ""Hey, what do we need to do
to make a whole city smog-free?""
											It's about the dream of clean air.
											We do workshops. New ideas pop up.
											These are smog-free bicycles
which — I'm Dutch, yes? —
											I have this ""bicycle DNA""
inside of me somewhere.
											And so it sucks up polluted air,
											it cleans it and releases it,
											in the fight against the car,
											in the celebration of the bicycle.
									","
											Ve şu anda, bu proje
Çin genelinde revaçta,
											aslında Çin genel hükumetinin desteği ile.
											İlk hedef havası temiz
yerel parklar oluşturmak
											ve bu oldukça iyi ilerliyor —
											%55 - %75 daha temiz.
											Ve aynı zamanda,
											STK'lar, valiler,
											öğrenciler,
											teknoloji insanlarıyla
											bir araya geldik ve:
											""Tüm bir şehri dumansız yapmak için
neye ihtiyacımız var?"" diye sorduk.
