											Il s'agit d'une toute nouvelle chanson.

											John, möchtest du das Lied vorstellen?
											Es ist ein Lied über eine sogenannte Kolibrimotte,

											das wiederum ein Wesen imitiert.
											Es ist total verwirrend
											und kann nur in einem Lied erklärt werden.

											Esta es una nueva canción.
											Siguiendo el espíritu de TED, presentaremos algo

											Esta canción trata de una criatura llamada polilla colibrí
											que imita a otra
											que a su vez imita a una tercera.
											Es algo muy retorcido
											que sólo puede explicarse cantando.

											Nous avons donc dépassé notre 1000ème concert.

											était en fait le plus froid que nous ayons jamais eu.
											Il faisait - 7°C à Saint-Louis il y a un mois
											et je suis heureux de vous annoncer

											Alors merci.

											So we are past our 1,000th show.
											Probably somewhere around 1,500.
											It's hard to know.
											We've only done two shows in 2007 so far,
											but our first show
											was actually the coldest performance we've ever had.
											It was 19 degrees in St. Louis about a month ago
											and I'm happy to report
											that this performance you are seeing today
											is the earliest we have ever performed.
											So thank you.
											We are cultural test pilots, ladies and gentlemen.
											How early can a rock performance begin?
											Not all the facts are in about performing
											at 8.30 in the morning.
											I can tell you the 19 degree thing
											was fantastic.
											All right.
									","
											Wir haben also mehr als 1.000 Shows.
											Wahrscheinlich um die 1.500.
											Kann man nur schwer sagen.
											Wir haben 2007 erst zwei Konzerte gegeben,
											aber das erste
											war die kälteste Vorstellung, die wir je gegeben haben.
											Vor etwa einem Monat waren in St. Louis -7 Grad
											und ich bin froh, Ihnen mitzuteilen,
											dass die heutige Vorstellung
											die früheste ist, die wir jemals gegeben haben.
											Vielen Dank also.
											Wir sind kulturelle Testpiloten, meine Damen und Herren.
											Wie früh kann ein Rockkonzert beginnen?
											Uns liegen noch nicht alle Informationen
											über Konzerte um 8:30 in der Frühe vor.
											Ich kann Ihnen aber sagen, diese Sache mit den Minusgraden
											war fantastisch.
											Na gut.
									","
											Hemos actuado más de mil veces.
											Quizá unas 1500 veces.
											Es difícil de saber.
											En 2007, hasta el momento hemos actuado dos veces
											pero la primer presentación
											realmente fue la más fría de la historia.
											Hacía -7°C en St. Louis hace un mes
											y me complace informarles
											que el horario del espectáculo de hoy
											es el más temprano de la historia.
											Muchas gracias.
											Somos pilotos de prueba culturales, damas y caballeros.
											¿A qué hora puede empezar un espectáculo de rock?
											No todo es cuestión de actuar
											a las 8:30 de la mañana.
											Sepan que actuar con -7°C
											fue fantástico.
											Muy bien.
