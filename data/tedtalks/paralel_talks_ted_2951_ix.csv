											Between 2004 and 2008,
											I unsuccessfully tried to get
into the Kenyan music industry.
											But the recurring answer from producers
											was I was not Kenyan enough.
											Meaning what?
											I didn't sing fully in the slang
derivative of Kiswahili
											and I didn't sing enough party tracks,
											so they said Kenyans wouldn't listen
to a Kenyan who sounded like me.
											This idea of otherism,
											the exclusion of a person
											based on their perceived
deviation from the norms,
											goes to the root of the problems in Kenya.
											And it runs deep.
									","
											Entre 2004 y 2008,
											intenté entrar en la industria musical
de Kenia, pero sin éxito.
											La respuesta de los productores 
era siempre la misma:
											que no era lo suficientemente keniana.
											¿A qué se referían?
											No cantaba en su totalidad en 
el dialecto derivado del suajili,
											no interpretaba
suficientes canciones festivas
											así que me dijeron que
											los kenianos no escucharían
a una keniana que hablara como yo.
											Esta idea de otredad,
											de la exclusión de una persona
											porque no se enmarca 
en el patrón establecido,
											es la raíz de los problemas de Kenia.
											Y está profundamente afianzada.
									","
											Entre 2004 et 2008,
											j'ai essayé en vain d'intégrer 
l'industrie musicale kényane.
											Les producteurs me répondaient toujours
											que je n'étais pas assez kényane.
											Que voulaient-ils dire ?
											Je ne chantais pas uniquement
en argot dérivé du kiswahili,
											et je ne chantais pas
assez de chansons festives.
											Alors, ils ont dit que les Kényans
n'écouteraient pas une Kényane comme moi.
											Cette idée d'extranéité,
											l'exclusion d'une personne,
											fondée sur la perception
qu'elle est hors norme,
											est à la base des problèmes du Kenya.
											Et elle y est solidement ancrée.

											Kenya was invented
by colonialists in 1895,
											and with it, came the erasure
of our identity
											and the class system built on otherism.
											So by 1963, when we received
our independence,
											these ideas had already become
the new normal.
											Now, we've tried a lot of different ways
to move forward since.
											We have a common language,
currency, infrastructure,
											basically all the things
that make a country a country.
											But all these efforts at nation-building
											do not go to the heart of the matter.
											Which is this:
											we cannot build what we do not truly love.
											And we cannot love
until we love ourselves.
											The thing we have to heal, us Kenyans,
											is our lack of self-love,
											our deep self-hate
											and our existential identity crisis.
											And this is the work of nation-building
											that only the creative industry can do.
									","
											En 1895, Kenia fue inventada 
por el colonialismo,
											el cual arrasó nuestra identidad
											y fundó un sistema de clases
construido sobre la otredad.
											Es decir que, en 1963, cuando
declaramos nuestra independencia,
											estas ideas ya eran
las normas establecidas.
											Desde entonces, hemos hecho 
lo posible para salir adelante.
											Compartimos un mismo idioma,
moneda, infraestructura;
											básicamente, todo lo que hace
que un país sea un país.
											Pero todos estos esfuerzos
de construir una nación
											no van el centro del problema,
											que es el siguiente:
											no se puede construir
lo que no se ama de verdad.
											Y no podemos amar
											si no nos amamos a nosotros mismos.
											Lo que debemos subsanar, como kenianos,
											en nuestra falta de amor propio,
											nuestro profundo odio por nosotros mismos
											y nuestra crisis existencial de identidad.
											Y esta tarea de construir una nación
											solo puede hacerse 
mediante la industria creativa.
									","
											Le Kenya a été inventé
par des colons en 1895,
											puis sont apparus
l'effacement de notre identité
											et la création d'une société
basée sur la différenciation.
											En 1963, quand nous sommes
devenus indépendants,
											ces idées étaient déjà
devenues la nouvelle norme.
											Depuis, nous avons essayé
de progresser de beaucoup de façons.
											Avec une langue, une monnaie,
des infrastructures communes.
											En gros, tout ce qui fait un pays.
											Mais tous ces efforts
pour construire une nation
											ne sont pas le cœur de mon sujet,
											qui est le suivant :
											on ne peut pas construire
ce qu'on n'aime pas sincèrement.
											Et on ne peut pas aimer
avant de s'aimer soi-même.
											Ce que nous devons guérir, nous Kényans,
											c'est notre manque d'amour-propre,
											notre haine profonde envers nous-mêmes
											et notre crise d'identité existentielle.
											C'est un travail de construction nationale
											que seule l'industrie
culturelle peut accomplir.

											The idea that Kenya
can only include some of us
											led me to found a music festival in 2008
called Blankest and Wine,
											to give a platform to myself
and other misfits.
											Ten years later,
we've programmed over 200 bands
											and put at least 100,000 dollars
											directly into the hands
of artists and managers,
											who have in turn spent it
on technicians, rehearsals,
											music videos and other things
along the music value chain.
											Our platform has allowed
for multiple Kenyan identities to exist,
											while inspiring the industry
to discover and engage
											the wide variety of Kenyan music.
											What we do is necessary but insufficient.
											And we must urgently pivot
into a live music circuit.
									","
											La idea de que en Kenia
solo hay lugar para algunos
											me llevó a fundar un festival de música
en 2008, 'Blankets and Wine',
											que funcionara como plataforma
tanto para mí como para otros excluidos.
											Diez años después,
programamos más de 200 bandas
											y pusimos, por lo menos, 100 mil dólares
											directamente a disposición
de los artistas y los representantes,
											quienes, a su vez, los gastaron
en técnicos, ensayos,
											videos musicales y demás insumos
en la cadena de valor de la música.
											Nuestra plataforma ha hecho visibles
a numerosas personalidades kenianas,
											y ha permitido a la industria
descubrir y contratar
											una amplia variedad de música local.
											Lo que hacemos es necesario,
pero no suficiente.
											Y es imperioso que organicemos
un circuito de música en vivo.

											Dix ans plus tard,
plus de 200 groupes y ont joué
											et au moins 100 000 dollars ont été remis
											directement aux artistes
et à leurs agents,
											qui les ont à leur tour investis
en techniciens, en répétitions,
											en clips vidéo, ou ailleurs dans la 
chaîne de valeur de l'industrie musicale.
											Notre plateforme a permis l'existence
de plusieurs identités kényanes,
											tout en incitant l'industrie

est nécessaire, mais insuffisant.
											Nous devons urgemment nous tourner

											But there are other ways
music can help heal the nation.
											According to a 2018 state of media report,
											traditional radio is sill by far
the biggest distributor of ideas in Kenya,
											with 47 percent of Kenyans
still choosing radio first.
											This presents an opportunity.
											We can use radio to help Kenyans hear
the diversity that is Kenya.
											We can reserve 60 percent
of all programing on Kenyan radio
											for Kenyan music.
											We can break down ethnic barriers
											by playing Kenyan music
done in English, Kiswahili
											and other ethnic languages,
											on what is now
single-language ethnic radio.
											Radio can help stimulate
interest and demand
											for Kenyan music by Kenyans,
											while also providing
the much-needed incomes
											by way of royalties.
											But more importantly,
											radio can help us build a more inclusive
narrative about Kenya.
											For you cannot love
what you do not know exists.
									","
											Pero la música puede ayudar 
a la nación de otras maneras.
											Según un informe de 2018 sobre los medios,
											la radio tradicional sigue siendo
el medio de mayor difusión en Kenia,
											donde un 47 % la prefieren
sobre otros medios.
											Esto representa una gran oportunidad.
											La radio permitiría a los kenianos
escuchar la diversidad que hay en el país.
											Se podría reservar un 60 % 
de la programación radial en Kenia
											para transmitir música local.
											Podemos derribar barreras étnicas
											con la difusión de música keniana
producida en inglés, en suajili
											y en otros idiomas étnicos,
											en una radio étnica que actualmente
transmite en un solo idioma.
											La radio puede despertar el interés
y generar una demanda
											de música keniana 
por parte de los kenianos,
											y al mismo tiempo generar 
los merecidos ingresos
											con el pago de derechos de autor.
											Pero lo más importante
es que la radio puede ayudarnos
											a construir una narrativa 
más inclusiva sobre Kenia.
											Porque no se puede amar
lo que no sabemos que existe.
									","
											Mais la musique peut aider à réconcilier
notre nation de bien d'autres façons.
											Selon un rapport sur les médias en 2018,
											la radio reste de loin le principal moyen
de diffuser des idées au Kenya,
											avec 47% des Kényans qui placent
toujours la radio en premier choix.
											Cela représente une opportunité.
											La radio peut servir à faire comprendre
aux Kényans la diversité du Kenya.
											60% de toute la programmation musicale
à la radio pourrait être réservée
											à la musique kényane.
											On peut faire tomber
les barrières ethniques
											en jouant de la musique kényane
en anglais, en kiswahili,
											et dans d'autres langues autochtones,
											sur ce qui est aujourd'hui
une radio ethnique monolingue.
											La radio peut stimuler
l'intérêt et la demande
											des Kényans pour la musique kényane,
											tout en lui fournissant
les revenus dont elle a besoin
											grâce aux droits d'auteur.
											Mais plus important encore,
											la radio peut nous aider à construire
un récit plus inclusif sur le Kenya.
											Car on ne peut pas aimer
ce dont on ignore l'existence.

											Other creative industries
too can do the work.
											When you consider
that 41 percent of Kenyans
											still choose TV as their primary medium,
											it's obvious that film
has a huge potential.
											The meager resources
that have been put into the sector
											have already produced world-class acts,
											like Lupita Nyong'o and Wanuri Kahiu,
											but we are going to need
a lot more incentives and investments
											to make filming in Kenya easier,
											so more Kenyan stories
can get on the Kenyan TV
											and spark off the really
difficult conversations
											we need to have with one another.
											We're going to need to grow
a lot more home-grown stars,
											so we can reverse the idea
											that we have to blow up abroad
											before we get the acceptance
and validation of home.
									","
											Esta tarea también se puede hacer
desde otros ámbitos creativos.
											Si tenemos en cuenta 
que el 41 % de los kenianos
											aún prefieren la TV sobre otros medios,
											es evidente que la industria fílmica
tiene un enorme potencial.
											Los escasos recursos
invertidos en el sector
											ya han producido espectáculos
de nivel internacional,
											como Lupita Nyong'o y Wanuri Kahiu,
											pero será necesario contar 
con más incentivos e inversiones
											para propiciar la industria fílmica local,
											facilitar el acceso de más historias
kenianas a la televisión
											y así poner sobre la mesa 
temas sumamente difíciles
											que debemos tratar entre todos.
											Habrá que favorecer el surgimiento
de más estrellas locales,
											y de este modo revertir la idea 
de que es preciso triunfar afuera
											para ser aceptados y valorados
en nuestra propia tierra.
									","
											D'autres industries culturelles
peuvent aussi y contribuer.
											Quand on sait que pour 41% des Kényans,
											la télévision est le média principal,
											le cinéma a évidemment
un énorme potentiel.
											Les maigres ressources
investies dans ce secteur
											ont déjà produit des vedettes mondiales
											comme Lupita Nyong'o et Wanuri Kahiu.
											Mais, nous aurons besoin de plus
d'incitations et d'investissements
											pour faciliter les tournages au Kenya,
											pour qu'il y ait davantage
de récits kényans à la télévision
											et pour déclencher
les conversations très difficiles
											que nous devons avoir entre nous.
											Nous allons avoir besoin
de beaucoup plus de vedettes nationales
											afin d'inverser le préjugé selon lequel
											notre succès doit se faire à l'étranger
											avant d'être acceptés et
estimés dans notre propre pays.

											to affordably mass-produce
Kenyan clothes for Kenyan consumers,
											so we don't all have to rely
