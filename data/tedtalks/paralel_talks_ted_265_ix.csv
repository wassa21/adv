											I've got a confession.
											I love looking through people's garbage.
											Now, it's not some creepy thing.
											I'm usually just looking
for old electronics,
											stuff I can take to my workshop and hack.
											I do have a fetish for CD-ROM drives.
											Each one's got three different motors,
											so now you can build things that move.
											There's switches so you can
turn things on and off.
											There's even a freaking laser,
											so you can make a cool robot
into an awesome robot.
									","
											Ich muss Ihnen etwas beichten.
											Ich wühle gerne im Müll anderer Leute.
											Es ist nichts Abartiges dabei.
											Ich suche bloß nach altem Elektroschrott,
											Zeug, das ich in meiner
Werkstatt zerhacken kann.
											Ich habe ein Fetisch für CD-ROM-Laufwerke.
											Jedes einzelne hat drei
verschiedene Triebwerke.
											Damit kann man bewegliche Teile bauen.
											Es gibt Schalter zum Ein- und Ausschalten.
											Es gibt sogar einen verdammten Laser.
											Und so kann man aus einem coolen,
einen total abgefahrenen Roboter machen.

											Now, I've built
a lot of stuff out of garbage,
											and some of these things
have even been kind of useful.
											But here's the thing,
											for me, garbage is just a chance to play,
											to be creative and build things
to amuse myself.
											This is what I love doing,
so I just made it part of my day job.
											I lead a university-based
biological research lab,
											where we value curiosity
and exploration above all else.
											We aren't focused
on any particular problem,
											and we're not trying to solve
any particular disease.
											This is just a place where people can come
											and ask fascinating questions
and find answers.
											And I realized a long time ago
											that if I challenge people
to build the equipment they need
											out of the garbage I find,
											it's a great way to foster creativity.
											And what happened
											was that artists and scientists
from around the world
											started coming to my lab.
											And it's not just because
we value unconventional ideas,
											it's because we test and validate them
											with scientific rigor.
									","
											Ich habe schon einiges aus Müll gebastelt.
											Und manches war auch irgendwie nützlich.
											Es ist nur so:
											Für mich ist Müll einfach
eine Gelegenheit zum Spielen,
											kreativ zu sein und
aus Spaß Dinge zu bauen.
											Ich liebe das, also habe ich es einfach 
zu einem Teil meiner Arbeit gemacht.
											Ich leite das biologische 
Forschungslabor einer Uni,
											wo wir Neugier und Forschungsdrang
über alles schätzen.
											Der Fokus liegt 
auf keinem bestimmten Problem
											und wir versuchen keine
bestimmte Krankheit zu heilen.
											Menschen können einfach herkommen,
											um spannende Fragen zu stellen 
und Antworten zu finden.
											Vor einiger Zeit wurde mir klar,
											dass wenn ich Menschen herausfordere,
ihr benötigtes Equipment
											aus dem Müll zu machen, den ich finde,
											das ist eine großartige Art,
ihre Kreativität zu fördern.
											Und was passierte war,
											dass Künstler und Wissenschaftler
aus der ganzen Welt
											plötzlich in mein Labor kamen.
											Nicht nur, weil wir
außergewöhnliche Ideen schätzen,
											sondern weil wir sie wissenschaftlich
testen und auswerten.

											So one day I was hacking something,
I was taking it apart,
											and I had this sudden idea:
											Could I treat biology like hardware?
											Could I dismantle a biological system,
											mix and match the parts
											and then put it back together
in some new and creative way?
											My lab started working on this,
											and I want to show you the result.
									","
											Einmal war ich dabei, 
etwas auseinanderzunehmen
											und hatte plötzlich diese Idee:
											Könnte ich mit Biologie 
wie mit Hardware umgehen?
											Könnte ich ein
biologisches System zerlegen,
											die Einzelteile vertauschen
											und in einer neuen, kreativen Weise 
wieder verbinden?
											Wir haben im Labor daran gearbeitet
											und ich will Ihnen das Ergebnis zeigen.

											Andrew Pelling:
That's right — it's an apple.
											Now, I actually want you to notice as well
											that this is a lot redder
than most apples.
											And that's because
we grew human cells into it.
											We took a totally innocent
Macintosh apple,
											removed all the apple cells and DNA
											and then implanted human cells.
											And what we're left with
after removing all the apple cells
											is this cellulose scaffold.
											This is the stuff that gives plants
their shape and texture.
											And these little holes that you can see,
											this is where all
the apple cells used to be.
											So then we come along,
											we implant some mammalian cells
that you can see in blue.
											What happens is,
these guys start multiplying
											and they fill up this entire scaffold.
									","
											Andrew Pelling: Das stimmt — ein Apfel.
											Ich will, dass Sie bemerken,
											dass dieser viel rötlicher ist
als ein gewöhnlicher Apfel,
											weil wir menschliche Zellen 
hineingezüchtet haben.
											Wir haben einen völlig unschuldigen
Macintosch-Apfel genommen,
											alle Apfelzellen und die DNA entfert
											und dann menschliche Zellen implantiert.
											Was nach dem Entfernen 
der Apfelzellen übrig bleibt,
											ist ein Gerüst aus Zellulose.
											Das gibt Pflanzen ihre Form und Struktur.
											Sie können hier kleine Löcher erkennen,
											wo vorher Apfelzellen waren.
											Jetzt kommen wir daher
											und implantieren Zellen 
eines Säugetiers: blau dargestellt.
											Diese vermehren sich
											und füllen das komplette Gerüst aus.

											As weird as this is,
											it's actually really reminiscent
of how our own tissues are organized.
											And we found in our pre-clinical work
											that you can implant
these scaffolds into the body,
											and the body will send in cells
and a blood supply
											and actually keep these things alive.
											This is the point
when people started asking me,
											""Andrew, can you make
body parts out of apples?""
											And I'm like, ""You've come
to the right place.""
									","
											So seltsam das sein mag,
											es zeigt eigentlich, 
wie unser Gewebe aufgebaut ist.
											Bei dieser präklinischen Arbeit 
erkannten wir,
											dass man das Gerüst in
den Körper implantieren kann.
											Der Körper füllt es mit Zellen, 
durchblutet es
											und hällt es so tatsächlich am Leben.
											An diesem Punkt fragen mich Leute:
											""Andrew, können Sie 
aus Äpfeln Körperteile machen?""
											Und ich sagte: ""Hier sind Sie richtig.""

											What's also really cool here
											is it's not that hard
to make these things.
											The equipment you need
can be built from garbage,
											and the key processing step
only requires soap and water.
											So what we did was put all
the instructions online as open source.
											And then we founded
a mission-driven company,
											and we're developing kits
to make it easier
											for anyone with a sink
and a soldering iron
											to make these things at home.
											What I'm really curious
about is if one day,
											it will be possible to repair, rebuild
and augment our own bodies
											with stuff we make in the kitchen.
									","
											Was daran auch total cool ist,
											ist, dass die Herstellung 
recht einfach ist.
											Alles, was man dazu braucht, 
kann aus Abfall hergestellt werden.
											Der wichtigste Schritt 
erfordert nur Wasser und Seife.
											Wir haben die Anleitung 
allgemein verfügbar ins Netz gestellt.
											Und eine auftraggesteuerte
Firma gegründet.
											Wir entwickeln Baukästen, 
um alles zu vereinfachen,
											damit jeder mit einem Waschbecken
und einem Lötkolben.
											so etwas daheim machen kann.
											Ich bin sehr gespannt, ob wir eines Tages
											unseren eigenen Körper, mit Dingen, 
die wir in der Küche herstellen,

											Now, I was in my kitchen,

the stalks of these asparagus,

are all these tiny little vessels.

forms these structures.
											This image reminds me of two things:
