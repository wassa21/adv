											It was about two years
after Hurricane Katrina
											that I first saw the Louisiana flood maps.
											These flood maps are used
to show land loss in the past
											and land loss that is to come.
											On this particular day,
at a community meeting,
											these maps were used to explain
											how a 30-foot tidal surge
that accompanied Hurricane Katrina
											could flood communities like mine
in south Louisiana
											and communities across
the Mississippi and Alabama coast.
											It turns out that the land we were losing
was our buffer from the sea.
											I volunteered to interact
with the graphics on the wall,
											and in an instant my life changed
for the second time in two years.
											The graphic showed
massive land loss in south Louisiana
											and an encroaching sea,
											but more specifically, the graphic showed
the disappearance of my community
											and many other communities
before the end of the century.

											I wasn't alone at the front of the room.
											I was standing there with other members
of south Louisiana's communities â€”
											black, Native, poor.
											We thought we were just bound
by temporary disaster recovery,
											but we found that we were now bound
by the impossible task
											of ensuring that our communities
would not be erased by sea level rise
											due to climate change.
											Friends, neighbors, family, my community:
											I just assumed it would always be there.
											Land, trees, marsh, bayous:
											I just assumed that it would be there
as it had been for thousands of years.
											I was wrong.

											To understand what was happening
to my community,
											I had to talk to other communities
around the globe.
											I started in south Louisiana
with the United Houma Nation.
											I talked to youth advocates
in Shishmaref, Alaska.
											I talked to fisherwomen
in coastal Vietnam,
											justice fighters in Fiji,
											new generations of leaders
											in the ancient cultures
of the Torres Straits.
											Communities that had been here
for thousands of years
											were suffering the same fate,
											and we were all contemplating
how we would survive the next 50.

											By the end of the next century,
											it's predicted that
more than 180 million people
											will be displaced due to climate change,
											and in south Louisiana,
											those who can afford to do so
are already moving.
											They're moving because
south Louisiana is losing land
											at one of the fastest rates on the planet.
											Disappearance is what my bayou community
											has in common with
other coastal communities.
											Erasure is what communities
around the globe are fighting
											as we get real about
the impacts of climate change.

											I've spent the last 14 years
advocating on behalf of communities
											that have been directly impacted
by the climate crisis.
											These communities
are fighting discrimination
											within climate disaster recovery,
											and they're also trying to balance
mass displacement of people
											with an influx of others
											who see opportunity in starting anew.
											Since 2005, people
have been called ""refugees""
											when they leave when they're displaced
by climate disaster,
											even when they don't cross
international borders.
											These terms, these misused terms,
											that are meant to identify the other,
											the victim,
											the person who is not supposed to be here,
											these terms are barriers
											to economic recovery,
											to social integration
											and to the healing required from
the climate crisis and climate trauma.
											Words matter.
											It also matters how we treat
people who are crossing borders.
											We should care about how people
who are crossing borders today
											to seek refuge and safety
are being treated,
											if for no other reason than it might
be you or someone you love
											who needs to exercise
their human right to migrate
											in the nearby future.

											We must start preparing
for global migration today.
											It's a reality now.
											Our cities and our communities
are not prepared.
											In fact, our economic system
and our social systems
											are only prepared to make profit
off of people who migrate.
											This will cause rounds
of climate gentrification,
											and it will also penalize
the movement of people,
											usually through exploited labor
											and usually through criminalization.
											Climate gentrification that happens
in anticipation of sea level rise
											is what we're seeing in places like Miami,
											where communities
that were kept from the waterfront
											are now being priced out
of the high ground
											where they were placed originally
											as people move away from the coast.
											These folks are being moved,
forced to relocate away
											from the social and economic systems
that they need to survive.

											Climate gentrification also happens
in the aftermath of climate disaster.
											When massive amounts
of people leave a location
											for an indefinite amount of time,
											we see others come in.
											We also see climate gentrification happen
											when damaged homes are now ""green built,""
											but now have a higher value,
											generally outside of the reach
of black and brown and poor people
											who want to return home.
											The price difference in rents
or the ownership of a house
											is the difference between
being able to practice your right,
											your human right
to return home as a community,
											or be forced to resettle somewhere else
											less climate resilient,
											less expensive
											and alone.

											The climate crisis
is a much larger conversation
											than reducing CO2 emissions,
											and it is a much different conversation
than just extreme weather.
											We're facing a shift
in every aspect of our global reality.
											And climate migration
is just one small part,
											but it's going to have ripple effects
											in both coastal cities
and cities in the interior.

											First, we must reframe
our understanding of the problem.
											Climate change is not the problem.
											Climate change
is the most horrible symptom
											of an economic system
											that has been built for a few
											to extract every precious value
out of this planet and its people,
											from our natural resources
											to the fruits of our human labor.
											This system has created this crisis.

											We must have the courage
to admit we've taken too much.
											We cannot close our eyes to the fact
											that the entire world is paying a price
											for the privilege and comfort
of just a few people on the planet.
											It's time for us to make
society-wide changes
											to a system that incentivizes consumption
											to the point of global imbalance.
											Our social, political and economic
systems of extraction
											must be transformed into systems
that regenerate the earth
											and advance human liberty globally.
											It is arrogance to think
that technology will save us.
											It is ego to think that we can continue
											this unjust and extractive approach
to living on this planet
											and survive.

											To survive this next phase
of our human existence,
											we will need to restructure
our social and economic systems
											to develop our collective resilience.
											The social restructuring must be
towards restoration and repair
											of the earth
											and the communities
that have been extracted from,
											criminalized
											and targeted for generations.
											These are the frontlines.
											This is where we start.

											We must establish a new social attitude
to see migration as a benefit,
											a necessity for our global survival,
											not as a threat
to our individual privilege.
											Collective resilience means developing
cities that can receive people
											and provide housing,
											food, water, health care
											and the freedom from overpolicing
											for everyone,
											no matter who they are,
											no matter where they're from.

											What would it mean if we started
to plan for climate migration now?
											Sprawling cities or declining cities
could see this as an opportunity
											to rebuild a social infrastructure
rooted in justice and fairness.
											We could actually put money
into public hospitals
											and help them prepare
											for what is to come
through climate migration,
											including the trauma
that comes with loss and relocation.
											We can invest more of our time in justice,
											but it cannot be for temporary gain,
											it cannot be to help budget shortfalls,
											it has to be for long-term change
											and it has to be to advance justice.
											It's already possible, y'all.

											So as we reframe the problem
in a more truthful way
											and we restructure our social systems
in a more just way,
											all that will be left is for us
to reindigenize ourselves
											and to conjure a power
of the most ancient kind.
											This necessarily means
that we must learn to follow â€”
											not tokenize, not exotify, not dismiss â€”
											the leadership and
the traditional knowledge
											of a particular local place.
											It means that we must commit
to standards of ecological equity
											and climate justice and human rights
											as the basis, a base standard,
											a starting point,
											for where our new society is to go.
