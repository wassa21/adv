											So if you live on planet Earth
											and you're one of seven billion people
that eats food every day,
											I need you to pay attention,
											because over the next three decades,
											we will need to address
											one of the most critical
global challenges of our generation.
											And I'm not talking about climate change.
											I'm talking about food and agriculture.
											In 2050, our global population
is projected to reach 9.8 billion,
											with 68 percent of us
living in urban city centers.
											In order to feed this massive population,
											we will need to increase
our agricultural output
											by 70 percent over current levels.
											Just to put this number into perspective,
											we will need to grow more food
in the next 35 to 40 years
											than the previous 10,000 years combined.
											Put simply, not only is our global
population becoming bigger,
											but it's also getting denser,
											and we will need to grow
significantly more food
											using significantly less
land and resources.

											Complicating our current efforts
to address these major demographic shifts
											are the challenges facing
the agricultural industry today.
											Globally, one third of all the food
that we produce is wasted,
											acquitting to 1.6 billion tons of food
											that spoiled on the way to the market
											or expired in our refrigerators
											or were simply thrown out
by supermarkets and restaurants
											at the end of the day.
											Every single year,
up to 600 million people
											will get sick eating contaminated food,
											highlighting the challenge that we have
of maintaining global food safety.
											And, maybe unsurprisingly,
											the agricultural industry
											is the single largest
consumer of fresh water,
											accounting for 70 percent of global usage.

											Now, you'll be relieved to know
											that the agricultural industry
											and that the global movement
by universities, companies and NGOs
											is putting together comprehensive research
											and developing novel technology
											to address all of these issues.
											And many have been doing it for decades.
											But one of the more recent
innovations in food production
											being deployed in industrial parks
in North America,
											in the urban city centers of Asia,
											and even in the arid deserts
of the Middle East
											is controlled environment agriculture.

											Controlled environment agriculture
is actually just a fancy way of saying
											weather- or climate-proof farming,
											and many of these farms grow food
three-dimensionally in vertical racks,
											as opposed to the two dimensions
of conventional farms.
											And so this type of food production
is also referred to
											as indoor vertical farming.

											I've been involved
in the indoor vertical farming space
											for the past five and a half years,
											developing technology
to make this type of food production
											more efficient and affordable.
											This picture was taken outside
of a decommissioned shipping container
											that we converted into an indoor farm
											and then launched into the heart
and the heat of Dubai.

											Indoor vertical farming
is a relatively recent phenomena,
											commercially speaking,
											and the reason for this is that consumers
care more about food safety
											and where their food comes from,
											and also, the necessary technology
to make this possible
											is more readily available and lower cost,
											and the overall cost of food production
globally is actually increasing,
											making this type of food production
more competitive.

											So if you want to build
an indoor vertical farm,
											you will need to replace some of
the conventional elements of farming
											with artificial substitutes,
											starting with sunlight.
											In indoor vertical farms,
											natural sunlight is replaced
with artificial lighting like LEDs.
											While there are many different types
of LEDs being used,
											the one that we decided to install here
											is called ""full spectrum LEDs,""
											which was optimized for the type
of vegetables that we were growing.
											Also, in order to maximize
production for a given space,
											indoor vertical farms also utilize
and install racking systems
											to grow vegetables vertically,
											and some of the biggest facilities
											stack their production
14 to 16 floors high.

											Now most of these farms are hydroponic
or aeroponic systems,
											which means that instead of using soil,
											they use a substitute material
like polyurethane sponges,
											biodegradable peat moss
											and even use inorganic materials
like perlite and clay pellets.
											Another unique aspects about these farms
											is that they use
a precise nutrient formula
											that is circulated and recycled
throughout the facility,
											and this is pumped directly
to the vegetables' root zone
											to promote plant growth.
											And lastly, these farms use
											a sophisticated monitoring
and automation system
											to significantly increase productivity,
											efficiency and consistency,
											and these tools also provide
the added benefit
											of producing food that is
more traceable and safe.

											Some of the obvious benefits
of growing food in this way
											is that you have year-round
vegetable production,
											you have consistent quality
and you have predictable output.
											Some of the other major benefits
											include significant
resource use efficiencies,
											particularly water.
											For every kilogram of vegetables
grown in this way,
											hundreds of liters of water is conserved
compared to conventional farming methods.
											And with the water savings
											come similar savings
in the use of fertilizer.
											One of the highest-yielding farms
											grows over 350 times more food
per square meter than a conventional farm.
											And weatherproofing
											means complete control
of incoming contaminants and pests,
											completely eliminating the need
for the use of chemical pesticides.
											And not to be mistaken,
											these farms can produce
enormous amounts of food,
											with one of the biggest facilities
											producing 30,000 heads
of vegetables a day.

											However, as with any
new technology or innovation,
											there are some drawbacks.
											As you would imagine,
											growing food in this way
can be incredibly energy-intensive.
											Also, these farms can only produce
a small variety of vegetables commercially
											and the overall cost of the production
still is quite high.

"
											And in order to address these issues,
											some of the biggest
and most sophisticated farms
											are making significant investments,
starting with energy efficiency.
											In order to reduce the high energy usage,
											there are efforts to develop
higher-efficiency LEDs,
											to develop lasers
optimized for plant growth
											and using even
fiber-optic cables like these
											to channel sunlight directly
into an indoor vertical farm
											during the day to reduce the need
for artificial lighting.

											Also, to reduce the labor costs associated
with hiring a more sophisticated,
											more urban and also
more high-skilled labor force,
											robotics in automation is used extensively
in large-scale facilities.
											And you can never really be
too resource-efficient.
											Building indoor vertical farms
in and around urban city centers
											can help to shorten
the agricultural supply chain
											and also help to maintain
the nutritional content in vegetables.
											Also, there are food deserts
in many countries
											that have little to no access
to nutritious vegetables,
											and as this industry matures,
											it will become possible
to provide more equitable access
											to high-quality,
highly nutritious vegetables
											in even the most
underprivileged of communities.

											And finally, and this is
really exciting for me personally,
											indoor vertical farming
can actually be integrated seamlessly
											into the cityscape
											to help repurpose idle, underutilized
and unused urban infrastructure.
											In fact, this is already happening today.
											Ride-sharing services have taken
hundreds of thousands of cars off the road
											and they have significantly reduced
the need for parking.

											This is a farm that we installed
in central Beijing
											in an underutilized
underground parking structure
											to grow vegetables for the nearby hotels.
											Underutilized infrastructure
											is not simply limited
to large-scale civil engineering projects,
											and they can also include smaller spaces
like idle restaurant corners.
											This is an example
of a farm that we installed
											directly into the partition
of a hotel entrance
											in order to grow fresh herbs
and microgreens on-site for the chefs.
											Honestly, if you look around,
											you will find underutilized
space everywhere,
											under, around and inside
of urban developments.
											This is a farm that we installed
into an empty office corner
											to grow fresh vegetables
for the employees in nearby cafes.

											And now that I've convinced you

											you'll be surprised and shocked to know
											that I still have trouble
											fully articulating how and why
I decided to work, and continue to work,
											in the agricultural industry.

											You see, I read an article

to your professional career.
											This is my Japanese last name:
											Oda.
											And the characters translate literally
