											In 1975, when I was seven years old,
											women in Iceland went on a strike.
											They did no work that day,
											whether they held professional jobs
											or had the work of the home.
											They marched into
the center of Reykjavík —
											90 percent of women participated —
											and peacefully and in solidarity
											asked for equality.
											Nothing worked in Iceland that day,
											because nothing works
when women are not at work.

											Elles ont défilé jusqu'au centre
de Reykjavik.
											90% des femmes ont participé.
											Elles ont manifesté dans le calme
et la solidarité
											pour exiger l'égalité.
											Ce jour-là, rien n'a pu
fonctionner en Islande.
											Rien ne fonctionne quand les femmes
ne sont pas au travail.

											Five years later,
Icelanders had the courage
											to be the first country in the world
											to democratically elect a woman
as their president.
											I will never forget this day,
											that President Vigdís,
as we know her by her first name,
											stepped out on the balcony
of her own home,
											a single mom with her daughter
by her side as she had won.

											It turns out that women
											are less likely
to consider running than men.
											So a study done in the US in 2011
											showed that 62 percent of men
had considered running for office,
											but 45 percent of women.
											That's gap of 16 percentage points,
											and it's the same gap
that existed a decade earlier.
											And it really is a shame,
											because I am so convinced that the world
is in real need for women leaders
											and more principle-based leadership
											in general.

											Il s'avère que les femmes
											envisagent moins leur candidature

											Une étude menée aux États-Unis en 2011

											C'est une différence de 16%.
											C'est la même différence
qui existait dix ans avant.
											C'est vraiment dommage
											parce que je suis convaincue que le monde
a grand besoin de dirigeantes
											et d'un leadership
qui a plus de principes,
											de manière générale.

											So my decision to run
											ultimately came down to the fact
											that I felt
											that I had to do my bit,
											even if I had no political experience,

of creating the world

											I can assure you
we had our own drama in Iceland.
											So our sitting president of 20 years
											announced initially
that he was not going to run,
											which is probably what gave rise
											to so many candidates considering running.
											Then later he changed his mind
											when our prime minister resigned
											following the infamous Panama Papers
											that implicated him and his family.
											And there was a popular
protest in Iceland,
											so the sitting president thought
they needed a trusted leader.
											A few days later, relations
to his wife and her family's companies
											were also discovered in the Panama Papers,
											and so he withdrew from the race again.
											Before doing so, he said he was doing that
											because now there were two qualified men
											who he felt could fill his shoes
running for office.
									","
											Je peux vous assurer que nous avons
nos propres péripéties en Islande.
											Notre Président, qui occupe son poste
depuis vingt ans,
											a d'abord annoncé
qu'il ne se représenterait pas.
											C'est sans doute ce qui explique
											la multiplication des candidatures.
											Plus tard, il a changé d'avis
											quand notre Premier Ministre a démissionné
											à la suite du scandale
des « Panama papers »
											auquel lui et sa famille sont mêlés.
											Le peuple islandais protestait,
											alors le président en exercice
											s'est dit qu'il leur fallait
un dirigeant de confiance.
											Quelques jours plus tard, des liens
avec sa femme et sa belle-famille
											ont été découverts dans les Panama papers.
											Il s'est donc à nouveau retiré
de la course.
											Avant de se retirer,
il a déclaré qu'il se retirait
											parce qu'il y avait désormais
deux hommes qualifiés dans la course
											qui avaient les épaules
pour occuper son poste.

											So on May 9, 45 days before election day,
											it was not looking too good for me.
											I did not even make the graph
in the newspaper.
											The polls had me at 1 percent,
											but that was still the highest
											that any woman announcing
her candidacy had earned.
											So it would be an understatement
to say that I had to work extremely hard
											to get my seat at the table
											and access to television,
											because the network decided
that they would only include
											those with 2.5 percent
or more in the polls
											in the first TV debate.
											I found out on the afternoon
of the first TV debate
											that I would participate
along with the three men,
											and I found out on live TV
											that I came in at exactly 2.5 percent
on the day of the first TV debate.
									","
											Alors, le 9 mai, à 45 jours de l'élection,
											le vent ne paraissait pas en ma faveur.
											Je n'apparaissais même pas
sur le graphique dans le journal.
											Les sondages disaient
que j'avais 1% d'intentions de vote.
											C'était quand même supérieur
											au score de toute autre femme
ayant annoncé sa candidature.
											Le moins qu'on puisse dire, c'est que
j'ai dû travailler d'arrache-pied
											pour avoir le droit de participer au débat
											et pour avoir accès à la télévision,
											parce que les chaînes
de télévision ont décidé
											que seuls les candidats
qui auraient 2,5% dans les sondages
											participeraient au premier débat télévisé.
											J'ai appris l'après-midi même du débat
											que j'allais y participer
avec les trois hommes
											et j'ai découvert en direct
à la télévision
											que j'avais obtenu précisément 2,5%
le jour du débat.

											So, challenges.
											The foremost challenges I had to face
and overcome on this journey
											had to do with media, muscle and money.
											Let's start with media.
											There are those who say
gender doesn't matter
											when it comes to media and politics.
											I can't say that I agree.
											It proved harder for me
to both get access and airtime in media.
											As a matter of fact, the leading candidate
appeared in broadcast media
											87 times in the months
leading up to the elections,
											whereas I appeared 31 times.
											And I am not saying
media is doing this consciously.
											I think largely this has to do
with unconscious bias,
											because in media,
much like everywhere else,
											we have both conscious
and unconscious bias,
											and we need to have the courage
to talk about it if we want to change it.
									","
											Parlons des difficultés
qui se sont présentées.
											Les plus grandes difficultés à surmonter
durant cette aventure
											ont été liées aux média, au pouvoir
d'appareil et à l'argent.
											Commençons par les médias.
											Certains disent que le genre importe peu
											dans les médias et en politique.
											Je ne suis pas d'accord.
											Il a été plus difficile pour moi d'accéder
aux médias et avoir de l'antenne.
											En vérité, les candidats en tête ont été
présents dans des émissions
											87 fois dans les mois
précédant l'élection,
											et moi seulement 31 fois.
											Je ne dis pas que les médias
sont conscients de ce qu'ils font.
											C'est dû en grande partie
à des préjugés inconscients, je crois.
											Les médias, comme tout le monde,
											ont des préjugés conscients
et inconscients.
											Nous devons avoir le courage d'en parler
pour que ça change.

"
											When I finally got access to TV,
											the first question I got was,
""Are you going to quit?""
											And that was a hard one.
											But of course, with 1 percent
to 2.5 percent in the polls,
											maybe it's understandable.
											But media really matters,
and every time I appeared on TV,
											we saw and experienced
a rise in the polls,
											so I know firsthand how much this matters
											and why we have to talk about it.
											I was the only one
out of the final four candidates
											that never got a front page interview.
											I was sometimes left out of the questions
asked of all other candidates
											and out of coverage about the elections.
											So I did face this,
											but I will say this
to compliment the Icelandic media.
											I got few if any comments
about my hair and pantsuit.
									","
											Quand j'ai enfin eu accès à la télévision,
											voici la première question que j'ai eue :
« Allez-vous abandonner ? »
											C'était difficile de répondre.
											Comme j'avais 1 ou 2,5% dans les sondages,
											ça se comprend peut-être.
											Les médias ont vraiment de l'influence
et à chacune de mes apparitions,
											je montais dans les sondages.
											Je suis bien placée pour savoir
combien c'est important
											et pourquoi il faut en parler.
											Je suis la seule
des quatre candidats en lice
											qui n'a pas eu d'interview
à la une des journaux.
											Parfois, on ne me laissait pas répondre
à des questions posées aux trois autres.
											Ou bien les médias
ne parlaient pas de moi.
											J'ai dû faire face à ça,
											mais je dirais une chose en faveur
des médias islandais,
											ils n'ont pas vraiment commenté
ma coiffure et mon tailleur.

											So kudos to them.
											But there is another experience
that's very important.
											I ran as an independent candidate,
											not with any political party
or muscle behind me.
											That lack of experience
											and lack of access to resources
											probably came at a cost to our campaign,
											but it also allowed us to innovate
and do politics differently.
											We ran a positive campaign,
											and we probably changed the tone
of the election for others by doing that.
											It may be the reason
why I had less airtime on TV,
											because I wanted to show
other contenders respect.
									","
											Un bon point pour eux.
											Une autre dimension
de mon expérience est importante.
											J'étais une candidate indépendante,
											sans appareil de parti derrière moi.
											Mon manque d'expérience
											et de ressources
											a probablement nuit à notre campagne
											mais nous a aussi aidés à innover
et à faire de la politique différemment.
											Nous avons mené une campagne positive
											et nous avons ainsi sans doute fait
changer le ton des élections.
											Peut-être que j'ai eu
moins de temps de parole
											parce que je montrais à mes opposants

											When access to media
proved to be so difficult,
											we ran our own media.
											I ran live Facebook sessions
											where I took questions from voters
on anything and responded on the spot.
											And we put all the questions I got
and all the answers on an open Facebook
											because we thought
transparency is important
											if you want to establish trust.
											And when reaching young voters
proved to be challenging,
											I became a Snapchatter.
											I got young people
to teach me how to do that,
											and I used every filter on Snapchat
during the last part of the campaign.
											And I actually had to use a lot of humor
and humility, as I was very bad at it.
											But we grew the following
amongst young people by doing that.
											So it's possible to run
a different type of campaign.
									","
											Quand accéder aux médias
s'est avéré si difficile,
											nous avons organisé nos propres médias.
											Des sessions en direct sur Facebook
											m'ont permis de répondre sur le vif
à des électeurs sur tous les sujets.
											Nous avons mis toutes ces questions
et réponses en libre accès sur Facebook
											parce que ne rien cacher est important
											pour établir une relation de confiance.
											Quand il s'est avéré difficile
d'avoir accès aux jeunes électeurs,
											je me suis mise à Snapchat.
											J'ai demandé à des jeunes de m'apprendre,
											j'ai utilisé tous les filtres de Snapchat
vers la fin de la campagne.
											J'ai dû faire preuve d'humour
et d'humilité parce que j'étais nulle.
											Grâce à ça, davantage de jeunes
ont suivi notre campagne.
											Il est donc possible d'avoir
une campagne électorale différente.

											But unfortunately, one cannot talk
about politics without mentioning money.
											I am sad that it is that way,
but it's true,
											and we had less financial resources
than the other candidates.
											This probably was partly due to the fact
											that I think I had a harder time
asking for financial support.
											And maybe I also had the ambition

											It's very important to mention this,

											We can never go the distance

and practices that nourish you,

maybe even more important,
											to have the courage
to get rid of people and practices

											What's really cool about this
											is that young women and men participated
											in greater numbers than before,
											because it is time
that we close the pay gap.

											Ce qui était cool,

											PM: So I'm not going to ask
Halla to commit right now
											to what she's doing next,
											but I will say that you'd have
a very large volunteer army
											should you decide to do that again.
											Thank you Halla.
									","
											PM : Je ne vais pas forcer Halla à révéler
											ses projets
											mais j'ajoute que vous auriez
une armée de bénévoles
											si vous décidiez
de vous présenter de nouveau.
											Merci, Halla.
