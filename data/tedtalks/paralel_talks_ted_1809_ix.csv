											Malaria is still one of
the biggest killers on the planet.
											Despite us making significant
progress in the last 20 years,
											half the world's population
is still at risk from this disease.
											In fact, every two minutes
a child dies from Malaria.
											Our progress has undoubtedly stalled.

											Now, we face many challenges
when it comes to tackling Malaria.
											But one of the problems that we have
											is actually finding people who are
infected with Malaria in the first place.
											So for example, if people have
some level of immunity to the disease,
											then they can develop an infection
											and become infectious
and still pass it on,
											but not actually develop any symptoms,
											and that can be a big problem
because how do you find those people -
											it's like looking for
a needle in a haystack.
											Now, scientists have been trying
to solve this problem for some years,
											but what I want to talk to you about
today is that the solution to this problem
											may have been right
under our noses this whole time.
											That was a bit of a heavy start
											with lots of really important
and serious statistics.
											So I want us all
to just relax a little bit now,
											help me to relax a little bit as well.
											So why don't we all take
a nice deep breath in.
											(Inhaling)
											Wow!
											And sigh.
											Okay, I'm going to get blown away there.
											(Laughter)
											Okay, now I want you to do it again,
											but this time I want you to do it
just through your nose,
											and I want you to really sense
the environment around you.
											And in fact,
											I want you to really smell the person
who's sitting next to you,
											even if you don't know them.
											I don't care! Lean in.
Get your nose right into their armpit.
											Stop being so British about it.
											Get your nose into the armpit,
have a good old sniff.
											See what you can smell.
											(Laughter)
											Now, each and everyone of us
											would have had a very different
sensory experience there.
											Some of us will have
smelt something rather pleasant,
											perhaps somebody's perfume.

											But some of us might've smelt something
a little bit less pleasant, perhaps -
											perhaps somebody's
bad breath or body odour.
											Maybe you even smelled
your own body odour.
											But there's probably a good reason
											that some of us don't like
certain body smells.
											Throughout history,
											there had been many examples
of diseases being associated with a smell.
											So for example, typhoid apparently
smells like baked brown bread.
											Well, that's quite a nice smell, isn't it?
											But it starts to get a little bit worse.
											TB smells like stale beer,
											and yellow fever smells like
the inside of a butcher shop,
											like raw meat.
											And in fact, when you look at the sort
of words used to describe diseases,
											you tend to find these words:
rotting, foul, putrid or pungent.
											So it's no surprise then,
											that smell and body odour
gets a bit of a bad reputation.
											If I was to say to you: 'You smell',
											you're going to take that not exactly
as a compliment, are you?
											But you do smell,
											you've just found that out,
you do smell.
											It's a scientific fact.
											I'd quite like to turn that on its head.
											What if we could actually think
about smell in a positive way?
											What if we could put it to good use?
											What if we could detect the chemicals
that are given off by our bodies
											when we're ill
											and use that to diagnose people?
											Now, we'd need to develop good sensors
that would allow us to do this.
											But it turns out that the world's
best sensors actually already exist.
											And they're called 'animals'.
											Now, animals are built to smell.
											They live their everyday lives
according to their nose.
											They sense the environments,
											which tells them
really important information
											about how to stay alive, essentially.
											Just imagine a mosquito.
											Imagine you're a mosquito,
											and you've just flown in from outside
and you've entered this room.
											You're going to be entering
a really complex world.
											You're going to be bombarded
with smells from everywhere.
											We've just found out
that we're really smelly beasts.
											Each one of us is producing
500-600 different volatile chemicals.
											It's not just one chemical like BO,
lots and lots of chemicals.
											But it's not just you,
											it's these seats you're sitting on,
											the carpet, the glue
that holds the carpet to the floor,
											the paint on the walls,
											the trees outside, everything
around you is producing an odour,
											and it's a really complex world
that the mosquito has to fly through,
											and it has to find you
within that really complex world.
											And each and every one of you will know -
											C'mon, hands up, who always
get bitten by mosquitoes?
											And hands up, who never get bitten?
											There's always one or two really
annoying people that never get bitten.
											But the mosquito has
a really hard job to find you,
											and that's all to do
with the way you smell.
											People who don't attract mosquitoes
smell repellent, and what we know is -
											(Laughter)
											I should clarify:
											repellent to mosquitoes,
											not to people.
											And what we know now is 
that is actually controlled by our genes.
											But mosquitoes are able to do that
											because they have a highly
sophisticated sense of smell,
											and they're able to see
through all this sort of odour sludge
											to find you, that individual,
and bite you as a blood meal.
											But what would happen if one of you
was infected with malaria?
											Well, let's just have a quick look
at the malaria life cycle.
											So it's quite complex,
but basically what happens is:
											a mosquito has to bite somebody
to become infected.
											Once it bites an infected person,
											the parasites travel
through the mouth part into the gut,
											and then bursts through the gut,
											creates cysts,
											and then the parasites replicate,
and then they make a journey
											from the gut all the way
to the salivary glands,
											where they are then injected
back into another person
											when the mosquito bites
because it injects saliva as it bites.
											Then inside the human
it goes through a whole other cycle,
											a whole other part of the life cycle.
											So it goes through a liver stage,
											changes shape and then comes
out into the bloodstream again,
											and eventually that person
will become infectious.
											Now, one thing we know
about the parasite world
											is that they are incredibly good
at manipulating their hosts
											to enhance their own transmission,
											to make sure that they get passed onwards.
											If this was to happen
in the malaria system, it might make sense
											that it would be something
to do with odour that they manipulate
											because odour is the key,
											odour's the thing that links us
between mosquitoes;
											that's how they find us.
											This is what we call the malaria
manipulation hypothesis,
											and it's something that we've been
working on over the last few years.
											So one of the first things
that we wanted to do in our study
											was to find out whether
an infection with malaria
											actually makes you more attractive
to mosquitoes or not.
											So in Kenya with our colleagues,
we designed an experiment
											where we had participants,
children in Kenya, sleep inside tents.
											The odour from the tent
was blown into a chamber
											which contained mosquitoes.
											And the mosquitoes
would behaviourally respond -
											they would fly towards
or fly away from the odours
											depending on whether
they liked them or not.
											Now, some of the participants
were infected with malaria
											and some of them were uninfected.
											But importantly, none of the children
had any symptoms whatsoever.
											Now, when we found and saw the results,
it was really quite staggering.
											People who were infected with malaria
											were significantly more attractive
than people who were uninfected.
											Let me explain this graph.
											We have a number of mosquitoes
attracted to the child,
											and we have two sets of data:
											before treatment and after treatment.
											On the far left hand side,
											that bar represents somebody -
or a group of people who are uninfected.
											And as we move towards the right hand side
these people have become infected,
											and they're moving towards the stage
that they're infectious.
											So right at the stage
when people are infectious
											is when they are
significantly more attractive.
											In this study then what we did is
we obviously gave the children treatment
											to clear the parasites,
and then we tested them again.
											And what we found was that
highly attractive trait that was there
											disappeared after
they had cleared the infection,
											so it wasn't just that the people
were more attractive,
											it was that the parasite
was manipulating its host in some way
											to make it more attractive to mosquitoes,
											standing out like a beacon
to attract more mosquitoes
											so that it could continue its life cycle.
											The next thing we wanted to do
was find out what it was
											the mosquito was actually smelling.
											What was it detecting?
											So to do that we had to collect
the body odour from the participants.
											And we did this by wrapping
bags around their feet,
											which allowed us to collect
the volatile odours from their feet.
											And feet's really important to mosquitoes.
											They really love the smell of feet.
											(Laughter)
											Especially cheesy feet.
											Anybody got cheesy feet out there?
											Mosquitoes love that smell.
											So we focused on the feet
and we collected the body odour.
											Now, when it comes to mosquitoes
and olfaction, their sense of smell,
											it's very complex.
											It would be really nice if there was just
one chemical that they detected,
											but it's not that simple.
											They have to detect a number
of chemicals in the right concentration,
											the right ratios, the right
combinations of chemicals.
											So you can sort of think about it
like a musical composition.
											So, you know, if you get the note wrong
or you play it too loud or too soft,
											it doesn't sound right.
											Or a recipe, if you get
an ingredient wrong,
											or you cook it too long or too little,
it doesn't taste right.
											Well, smell is the same,
											it's made up of a suite of chemicals
in the right combination.
											Now, our machines in the lab
are not particularly good
											at picking out this sort
of signal; it's quite complex.
											But animals can.
											And what we do in my laboratory
is we connect microelectrodes
											to the antenna of a mosquito -
											imagine how fiddly that is.
											(Laughter)
											But what we also do is connect
them to individual cells
											within the antenna, which is incredible.
											You definitely don't want to sneeze
when you're doing this experiment,
											that's for sure.
											But what this does is it allows us
to measure the electrical response
											of the smell receptors in the antennae,
											and so that we can see
what a mosquito is smelling.
											I'm going to show you what this
looks like: here's an insect's cell,
											and it's responding; it will respond
in a second when I press this button.
											You'll see it sort of ticking over
with this response.
											An odour will be blown over the cell,
											and it will sort of go a bit crazy,
sort of blow a raspberry.
											Then it will go back to its resting
potential when we stop the odour.
											(Clicking)
											Okay, there we go.
											So you can go home now and say
that you've now seen an insect smelling
											and even hearing an insect smelling.
											It's a weird concept, isn't it?
											But this works really well,
											and this allows us to see
what the insect is detecting.
											Now, using this method
with our malaria samples,
											we were able to find out
what the mosquito was detecting.
											And we found the malaria
associated compounds
											were a group of compounds,
mainly aldehydes,
											a group of compounds that smelled,
that signified the malaria at signal here.
											So now we know
what the smell of malaria is,
											and we've used the mosquito
as a bio-sensor
											to tell us what the smell
of malaria actually is.
											Now, I'd like to imagine that you could,
											I don't know, put a harness
on a little mosquito
											and, you know, put it on a lead
and take it out
											and see if we can sniff people
in a community -
											that goes on in my head -
											and see whether we could actually
find people with malaria.
											But, of course,
that's not really possible.
											But there is an animal
that we can do that with.
											Awww.
											(Laughter)
											Yes.
											Now, dogs have
an incredible sense of smell,
											but there's something
a little bit more special about them,
											they have an ability to learn.
											And most of you will be familiar
with this concept at airports,
											where dogs will go down a line
and sniff out your luggage or yourself
											for drugs and explosives
or even food as well.
											So we wanted to know: Could we actually
train dogs to learn the smell of malaria?
											And so we've been working with a charity
called Medical Detection Dogs
											to see whether we can train them
to learn the smell of malaria.
											And we went out to the Gambia
and did some more odour collection
											on children that were infected
and uninfected.
											But this time we collected their odour
by making them wear socks,
											nylon stockings
to collect their body odour,
											and we brought them back to the UK,
											and then we handed them
to this charity to run the experiment.
											Now, I could show you a graph
											and tell you about
how that experiment works,
											but it'd be a bit dull, wouldn't it?
											Now, they do say never work
with children or animals live.
											But we're going to break that rule today.
											So, please welcome onto the stage,
											Freya
											(Applause)
											and her trainer,
											(Applause)
											Mark,
											and Sarah.
											Of course this is
the real star of the show.
											Okay so, now what I'm going to ask
											is if you can all
just be a little bit quiet,
											don't move around too much.
											This is a very strange
environment for Freya.
											She's having a good look at you guys now.
											So let's stay as calm
as possible; that would be great.
											So what we're going to do here
is we're going to ask Freya
											to move down this line
of contraptions here.
											And in each one of these
contraptions we have a pot.
											In the pot is a sock that's been worn
by a child in The Gambia.
											Now, three of the socks had been worn
by children who were uninfected,
											and just one of the socks was worn
by a child who was infected with malaria.
											So just as you'd see an airport,
imagine these were people,
											and the dog is going to go down
and have a good sniff.
											And let's see if you can see
when she senses the malaria.
											And if she senses it in there.
											This is a really tough test for her
in this very strange environment.
											So I'm going to hand over now to Mark.
											(Laughter)
											Number three.
											Okay, there we go.
(Applause)
											I didn't know which pot that was in.
											Mark didn't know which pot that was in.
											This was a blind test, genuinely.
											Sarah, was that correct?
											That was correct.
											Well done, Freya!
											That is fantastic.
											(Applause)
											Whew!
											That is really wonderful.
											Okay, that's brilliant.
											Now what we're going to do
											is Sarah's going to change
the pots around a little bit;
											she's going to take
the one with malaria away.
											And we're just going to have four pots
that are containing socks from children
											that had no malaria.
											So in theory, Freya should
go down the line and not stop at all.
											This is really important
because we also need to know
											people who are not infected;
											she needs to be able
to do that correctly as well.
											This is a really tough test.
											These socks have been in the freezer
for a couple of years now.
											And this is a tiny bit of a sock as well,
											so imagine if this was a whole person
and they were giving off a big signal.
											So this is really quite incredible.
											Okay, over to you, Mark.
											Brilliant!
											Fantastic!
											(Applause)
											Really super!
											Thank you so much, guys.
											Big round of applause
for Freya, Mark and Sarah!
											Well done, guys.
											(Applause)
											What a good girl.
											She's going to get a treat later.
											Fantastic.
											So, you've just seen that
for your own eyes.
											That was a real live demonstration.
											I was quite nervous about it.
I'm so glad that it worked.
											(Laughter)
											But it is really incredible,
and when we do this,
											what we find is that these dogs
can correctly tell us
											when somebody's infected
with malaria 81% of the time.
											It's incredible!
											92% of the time,
they can tell us correctly
											when somebody does not
have an infection.
											And those numbers
are actually above the criteria
											set by the World Health Organization
											for a diagnostic.
											So we really are looking
at deploying dogs in countries,
											and particularly at ports of entry,
											to detect people who have malaria.
											This could be a reality.
											But we can't deploy dogs everywhere.
											So what we're also looking to do
and working on at the moment
											is the development of technology,
											wearable tech
											that would empower the individual
to allow them to self-diagnose.
											Imagine a patch that you wear on the skin
											that would detect in your sweat
when you're infected with malaria
											and change colour.
											Or something a little bit
more technical perhaps,
											a smartwatch that would alert you
when you're infected with malaria.
											And if we can do this digitally,
and we can collect data,
											imagine the amount of data
that we can collect on a global scale.
											This could completely revolutionise
											the way that we track
the spread of diseases,
											the way that we target our control efforts
and respond to disease outbreaks,
											ultimately helping to lead
to the eradication of malaria,
											and even beyond malaria
											for other diseases
that we already know have a smell.
											If we can harness the power of nature
											to find out what those smells are,
we could do this and make this a reality.
											Now, as scientists, we're tasked
with coming up with new ideas,
											new concepts, new technologies,
											to tackle some of the world's
greatest problems.
											But what never ceases to amaze me
											is that often, nature
has already done this for us.
											And the answer
											is right under our nose.
											Thank you.
											(Applause) (Cheers)
