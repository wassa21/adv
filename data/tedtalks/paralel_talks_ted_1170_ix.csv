											Keith Kirkland: We believe
in making the world a better place,
											and we're trying
to do that through design,
											but the world for us
starts with our company.

											Our first product, Wayband,
											is a wearable haptic navigation device
for the blind and visually impaired.
											We had gotten an article published
and it had made its way to this guy,
											Simon Wheatcroft.
											He reached out to us and he was like,
											""If you can have this technology
ready by November,
											I'll run the New York City
Marathon with it.""
											We saw it and was kind of like, moonshot,
this is probably not going to work,
											but let's just do it
and see how far we can get.

											Jennifer Brook: In Keith's story,
I see a microcosm
											that reflects a greater macrocosm
in terms of an emerging set of values.
											What we found is that everyone has
a set of tensions in their work and life,
											things like making a living
and making a life,
											or fulfilling the organization's needs
and the needs of the individual.
											We navigate those tensions
using our own unique strategies,
											for example, working remotely,
learning new skills, or self care.
											Navigating these tensions is critical,
											because a lot is at stake for us
when we show up to work,
											like our sense of purpose
											or our connection
to our families and communities.
											And for me, in this organization,
											this is why we should care about designing
a more enlightened way of working.

											KK: We see a company
as a vehicle to design life with
											as opposed to something to conform to.

											JB: WearWorks is really
thinking holistically
											about navigating their tensions.
											For example, when it comes to a tension
like making a living and making a life,
											what kinds of cultural practices
and policies need to be in place
											to support a strategy
like flexible or remote work?

											KK: At WearWorks, we have this policy
called WhereverWorks,
											and the basic idea is
that we don't really care where people are
											as long as the work gets done.
											And by doing so,
											we make our employees ridiculously happy.
											And by doing that,
we get the best work from people.

											JB: We're seeing that people everywhere
											are challenging these inherited,
default ways of working.
											They want access
to more choices, more agency,
											the freedom to decide
how they want to work.
											This supports them to better navigate
the tensions in their work and life
											for the sake of preserving
what's at stake for them.

											KK: We did a six-month sprint,
											and on November 5, 2017,
											Simon ran the first 15 miles
of the New York City Marathon
											without any sight assistance.
											Working with the blind
and visually impaired
											was a wonderful challenge.
											It's a different feeling
when you go to work every day
											and the thing that you do
											actually helped the needle of humanity,
in some way, move forward.
