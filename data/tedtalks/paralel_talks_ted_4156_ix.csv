											Victor Vescovo: That's the bottom
of the Atlantic Ocean,
											and I guess I read too much
Jules Verne as a young boy,
											and so for the last four years
I've led a team to design and build
											what is now the most advanced and deepest
diving submersible on the planet,
											and I have the ability
to personally pilot it too.
											So this was us in December of last year,
											for the first time —
the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.

au monde,

different to go diving.
											If you're claustrophobic,

											But you can see from the left
a creature that's never been seen before.
											It's actually a bottom-dwelling jellyfish
called a stalked ascidian,
											and none of them
have ever looked like this before.
											It actually has a small child
at the bottom of its stalk,
											and it just drifted across beautifully.
											So every single dive we have gone on,
											even though we're only down there
for a couple of hours,
											we have found three or four new species
											because these are places that have
been isolated for billions of years
											and no human being has ever
been down there to film them
											or take samples.
											And so this is extraordinary for us —
									","
											Et à gauche, une créature
jamais vue auparavant.
											C'est un animal gélatineux à queue
de la famille des ascidies,
											à l'aspect très différent
du reste de la famille.
											Elle a un petit alevin
accroché au bout de sa queue
											et nage gracieusement devant la caméra.
											Durant chacune de nos plongées,
											bien que nous n'y soyons restés
que quelques heures,
											nous avons découvert
trois ou quatre espèces,
											car ces endroits ont été isolés
pendant des milliards d'années
											et aucun humain ne s'y était aventuré
pour filmer ou récolter des échantillons.
											Donc pour nous, c'est extraordinaire.

											So what we are hoping —
											the main objective of our mission
is to build this tool.
											This tool is a door,
											because with this tool,

more of them potentially
											and take scientists down
to do thousands of dives,
											to open that door to exploration
											and find things that we

											This is a third-generation technology.
											We're not only going to try and go down,
actually in two weeks,
											but we're going to try
and do it multiple times,
											which has never been done before.
											If we can do that,
we'll have proven the technology
