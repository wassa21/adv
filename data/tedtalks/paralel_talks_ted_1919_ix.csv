											When I was a teen, I had terrible periods.
											I had crippling cramps,
											I leaked blood onto my clothes
and onto my bed sheets,
											and I had period diarrhea.
											And I had to miss school
one to two days a month,
											and I remember sitting on the couch
with my heating pads, thinking,
											""What's up with this?""
											When I ate food, I didn't leak saliva
from my salivary glands.
											When I went for a walk,
											I didn't leak join fluid from my knees, 
""joint fluid.""
											Why was menstruation so different?

											I wanted answers to these questions
											but there was no one for me to ask.
											My mother knew nothing about menstruation
											except that it was dirty and shameful
and I shouldn't talk about it.
											I asked girlfriends
											and everybody spoke in euphemisms.
											And finally, when I got the courage
to go to the doctor
											and talk about my heavy periods,
											I was told to eat liver.

											It's just a patriarchal society is
invested in oppressing women,
											and at different points in our lives,
different things are used.
											And menstruation is used
											during what we in medicine call
the reproductive years.
											It's been around since
pretty much the beginning of time,
											many cultures thought
that women could spoil crops
											or milk, or wilt flowers.
											And then when religion came along,
											purity myths only made that worse.
											And medicine wasn't any help.
											In the 1920s and '30s
											there was the idea that women elaborated
something called a menotoxin.
											We could wilt flowers just by walking by.

											And that's what happens
when there's no diversity, right.
											Because there was no woman
to put her hand up and go,
											""Well, actually, that doesn't happen.""
											And when you can't talk
about what's happening to your body,
											how do you break these myths?
											Because you don't even need to be a doctor
											to say that periods aren't toxic.
											If they were, why would an embryo
implant in a toxic swill?
											And if we all had this secret menotoxin,
											we could be laying waste
to crops and spoiling milk.

											That's how effective

											So I began to think,
											""Well, what if everybody knew
about periods like a gynecologist?
											Wouldn't that be great?""
											Then you would all know what I know,
											you'd know that menstruation
											is a pretty unique
phenomenon among mammals.
											Most mammals have estrus.
											Humans, some primates,
											some bats,
											the elephant shrew
and the spiny mouse menstruate.
											And with menstruation what happens is
the brain triggers the ovary
											to start producing an egg.
											Estrogen is released
											and it starts to build up
the lining of the uterus,
											cell upon cell, like bricks.
											And what happens if you build
a brick wall too high without mortar?
											Well, it's unstable.
									",Why can't we talk about periods?,Jen Gunter,11:42,"society,women,biology,health care,health,medicine,feminism,science,human body,social change,public health,sex"
"
",Why can't we talk about periods?,Jen Gunter,11:42,"society,women,biology,health care,health,medicine,feminism,science,human body,social change,public health,sex"
"
											So what happens when you ovulate?
											You release a hormone called progesterone,
											which is progestational,
it gets the uterus ready.
											It acts like a mortar
and it holds those bricks together.
											It also causes some changes
											to make the lining more hospitable
for implantation.
											If there's no pregnancy,
											(Whoosh)
											lining comes out,
											there's bleeding from the blood vessels
and that's the period.
											And I always find this point
really interesting.
											Because with estrus,
											the final signaling to get
the lining of the uterus ready
											actually comes from the embryo.
											But with menstruation,
											that choice comes from the ovary.
											It's as if choice is coded in
to our reproductive tracts.

											OK, so now we know why the blood is there.
											And it's a pretty significant amount.
											It's 30 to 90 milliliters of blood,
											which is one to three ounces,
											and it can be more,
											and I know it seems like it's more
a lot of the times.
											I know.
											So why do we have so much blood?
											And why doesn't it just stay there
till the next cycle, right?
											Like, you didn't get pregnant,
so why can't it hang around?
											Well imagine if each month it got thicker
and thicker and thicker, right,
											like, imagine what tsunami
period that would be.

											We can't reabsorb it,
because it's too much.
											And it's too much because we need
a thick uterine lining
											for a very specific reason.

biological toll on our bodies.
											There is maternal mortality,
											there is the toll of breastfeeding

											But evolution knows
about risk-benefit ratio.
											And so evolution wants to maximize
the chance of a beneficial outcome.
											And how do you maximize the chance
of a beneficial outcome?
											You try to get the highest
quality embryos.
											And how do you get
the highest quality embryos?
											You make them work for it.
											You give them an obstacle course.
											So over the millennia
that we have evolved,
											it's been a little bit
like an arms race in the uterus,
											the lining getting thicker
and thicker and thicker,
											and the embryo getting more invasive
											until we reach this dÃ©tente
											with the lining
of the uterus that we have.

											So we have this thick uterine lining
											and now it's got to come out,
											and how do you stop bleeding?
											Well, you stop a nose bleed
by pinching it,
											if you cut your leg,
you put pressure on it.
											We stop bleeding with pressure.
											When we menstruate,
											the lining of the uterus
releases substances
											that are made into chemicals
called prostaglandins
											and other inflammatory mediators.
											And they make the uterus cramp down,
											they make it squeeze
on those blood vessels
											to stop the bleeding.
											They might also change
blood flow to the uterus
											and also cause inflammation
and that makes pain worse.

											One way is with something
called a TENS unit,
											which you can wear under your clothes

the gate theory of pain,

											We also have medications

anti-inflammatory medications.
											And what they do is they block
the release of prostaglandins.
											They can reduce menstrual pain
for 80 percent of women.
											They also reduce the volume of blood
by 30 to 40 percent
											and they can help with period diarrhea.
											And we also have hormonal contraception,
											which gives us a thinner
lining of the uterus,
											so there's less prostaglandins produced
											and with less blood,
there's less need for cramping.

											If that treatment fails you,
