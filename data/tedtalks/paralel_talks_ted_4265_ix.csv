											(Directing Bailey in English)
											Hello, everyone.
											My name is Yuko Morita.
											This is a facility dog, Bailey.
											When you were a kid,
were you afraid of getting shots?
											When you were getting 
a flu shot at school,
											you probably asked your friends,
'Did it hurt? Did it hurt?'
											As you know, kids are 
very afraid of injections
											or having their blood drawn.
											Hospitalised children have to have 
their blood drawn so many times.
											Some kids need bone-marrow aspirations
											by drilling a thick needle 
into their spine.
											This dog, Bailey has the magical power 
to make these kids say:
											'If Bailey is with me,
I would put up with it 100 more times'.
											He is such a competent dog.
											The Japanese medical level 
is said to be top-notch,
											for curing diseases.
											But in Japan, while 'to be patient' 
has been considered a virtue,
											it is said that the quality 
of hospitalised life is poorly supported.
											I used to work as a registered nurse 
at a children's hospital in Tokyo.
											One day a mother 
of a hospitalised kid said,
											'This is almost like being in jail'.
											I was thinking that I was working 
very hard for the children,
											and I was very shocked to hear that.
											In fact, kids in the hospital are not 
supposed to go out even for a walk.
											They are not allowed 
to have their favourite foods.
											They barely have fun.
											Some kids stop smiling.
											When I think back about it,
it might as well be called a jail.
											At that time,
I was with an NPO
											called 'Shine On! Kids'
											and they offered to let me 
become a handler of a service dog.
											The Non-Profit Organisation was founded 
to emotionally support kids
											and their families who are suffering 
from childhood cancer
											and other incurable diseases.
											At that time, I only knew that 
a dog is taken to a children's hospital
											and the dog works as a member 
of the medical staff —
											there were a number of facility dogs 
working in Europe and the US,
											yet obiously none in Japan;
											that was all I knew about facility dogs.
											I thought 'If a service dog 
were working in this ward,
											the children's hospital life,
once called a jail, would be way happier',
											and I was excited to think so.
											Without hesitation I said,
'Yes, I would love to'.
											There is no training institutions 
for facility dog program in Japan.
											Both Bailey and I were trained 
at a Hawaiian training centre.
											In a children's hospital in Hawaii,
											we also practiced following around 
our senior facility dog and their handler.
											To my surprise, the service dog 
went into the ICU.
											The intensive-care unit is where 
seriously ill patients are taken care of.
											There was a child who had just gotten out 
of surgery with their head half-shaven,
											and a large scar on their head.
											The kid was frowing painfully.
											To my great concern, 'Is it really OK 
to go there in such a serious situation?'
											the facility dog went in there,
											and climbed on the bed 
right beside the kid
											laying with the tubes around them,
and went to sleep alongside the kid.
											Then the kid grew relaxed.
											In spite of all the pain of moving,
											the kid hugged the dog 
and closed their eyes.
											The kid looked so calm and easy.
											At the sight of it,
I thought ’WOW, that's cool!’
											Being excited about making 
all the hospital wards full of smiles,
											I came back to Japan with Bailey.
											However, facility dogs are totally 
unprecedented in Japan.
											The Western mindset for dogs 
is totally different from that of Japan.
											In Europe and the US, it's been 
quite normal to have dogs
											in the house as family members.
											On the other hand, in Japan,
we have a history of having them outside.
											It is outrageous to have a dog 
inside the hospital ward:
											that was what Japanese hospitals thought.
											Before us, sometimes there were dogs 
volunteered to visit hospitals in Japan.
											But there was not a precedent
											of having a dog in hospital everyday,
and considering dogs as a medical staff.
											What was right in Hawaii 
was far from right in Japan.
											We desperately looked for a hospital 
that could accept Bailey as a staff.
											Then eventually we were accepted 
by the Shizuoka Children's Hospital.
											But the reality was that people said;
											'Can't the dog be replaced 
with a dog robot?'
											or 'To protect kids against infections,
do not enter this ward'.
											At first we could enter only one ward.
											So one-day of rounds was finished 
in a few minutes.
											We got to the workplace and an hour later,
it was time to go home.
											'I don't think Japanese culture 
is going to make people
											want to adopt a facility dog programme',
I could only think in a negative way.
											But in fact, children needed Bailey.
											Five years have passed,
											and now we are accepted 
by almost all wards.
											Bailey brings about positive differences 
to both kids and their families',
											— that was what doctors and nurses 
started to notice.
											There was a child 
who was visually impaired
											and was always screaming in panic 
when they had their blood collected.
											But with Bailey by their side, they were 
distracted by petting Bailey on the head,
											the kid could go through blood tests 
without crying.
											Another kid who wouldn’t move at all 
due to pain after surgery
											suddenly got up 
just because they wanted to see Bailey.
											That was a big surprise to the doctor.
											A family, who are suddenly told 
that their child has cancer,
											will pretend as if nothing happening 
to prevent their kid from being nervous.
											But people cannot suppress 
their feelings for good.
											Sometimes it is important to cry.
											With somebody who is human,
											they would feel a need 
'to say something'.
											But to Bailey, they never have to 
say anything if they do not want to.
											I saw a mother in a hospital corridor,
after hugging Bailey, crying as she wanted
											and with a relaxed expression,
she went back to her kid's bed.
											Bailey was a positive influence 
for their families, too.
											Then I found there are 
three important bonds for a facility dog.
											One is a bond between Bailey and the kids,
											another is Bailey and his handler,
											and the other is 
Bailey and the medical staff.
											These are three important bonds 
with Bailey.
											The first bond is:
											as Bailey works 
at the same hospital everyday,
											he sees the same children many times.
											For children, just having a dog 
is not good enough.
											Bailey, who comes to them everyday,
really matters.
											Only with Bailey 
who has bonds with the kids,
											can they be courageous enough 
to hang in there.
											Even with a dog phobia, almost all kids 
will come to like Bailey eventually.
											For kids, Bailey is a teammate with a tail
who fight against their illness.
											Bailey can even enter 
the surgical theatre with a child.
											Even an adult is scared 
of getting an operation, right?
											Wondering 'Does it hurt?',
or feeling scared,
											they have to spend the terrifying time 
from the ward to the theatre.
											But holding Bailey's leash,
walking with him,
											children can guide Bailey 
smiling and walking to the theatre.
											It is a privilege walk with everyone's 
favourite Bailey, without anyone else!
											Some kids walk playfully 
around Bailey's fluffy tail
											as if they are cats.
											Some kids say smiling, 'Bailey's 
wagging his tail means Good Luck'.
											In this way, scary feelings 
turn to exciting feelings;
											which encourages kids 
to go to the theatre.

											The second bond is:
											between a facility dog and their hander,
who live together twenty-four seven.
											We always spend holidays together too.
											This is very important;
just getting together while working
											and saying 'Bye-Bye' after five 
doesn't make any sense.
											We sleep at night and Bailey sleeps 
with his head on my arm.
											The bond between a facility dog 
and their handler
											is the basis on which a facility dog 
works professionally.
											Only the bond with me
											can convince Bailey 
to trust me to work together.
											But the truth is;
											you may think that a training dog 
will do anything I say,
											Bailey is a stubborn guy 
who goes only where he wants.
											To a direction he doesn't to want to go,
he does like this.
											Can you see he is hanging on 
with all his might?
											Planting his feet firmly on the ground,
digging his nails into it,
											he never goes where he doesn't want to.
											While walking on the street,
											I sometimes struggle 
with Bailey sitting there.
											People passing by always say laughing,
'That's troublesome'.
											But he has never refused 
to go to the hospital.
											On the contrary, he sometimes 
refuses to go home, squatting there,
											going back into the hospital ward.
											Dogs easily understand 
what people are thinking about them.
											Because there are many people 
who love him,
											Bailey loves the hospital very much.
											Both a dog and people 
are mutually affected;
											that is where the facility dog belongs.
											This is why non-sentient toy dogs 
cannot make this happen.
											A robot dog can not make this happen.
											The third bond is 
between Bailey and the medical staff.
											The handler of a facility dog 
is a medical staff.
											The reason why only medical staff 
can be a handler of a facility dog is:
											that a facility dog's work includes 
not only healing mentally,
											but also curing physically.
											Bailey and I sometimes take a part 
in the conversations
											where treatment courses 
of patients are decided.
											I also figure out 
how our patient kids are
											and work out 
how to approach this patient.
											I also write on the medical charts.
											In this way, to be involved 
with specific purpose
											is what only facility dogs are capable of,
											and why a handler of a facility dog 
must be certified medical staff.
											It has been five years since Bailey and I 
started working in Japan.
											We have met thousands of children.
											We once met a kid 
in the terminal phase of disease
											and the kid could not eat.
											He wanted to but he couldn't eat;
that was his situation.
											Given a short span of time,
both his family and nurses
											wished that he could enjoy 
whatever little amount of food he could.
											Then there was a suggestion made 
Bailey attended at his dinner table.
											With Bailey, the kid 
was happy to sit up smiling.
											Saying, 'Bailey, look at me',
											though it was only a few mouthful,
but he could managed to grab spaghetti
											into his mouth.
											He could also enjoy ice cream,
											not being forced to do so,
but willingly to do so.
											Only the presence of Bailey bedside 
could make that level of change.
											The bad impression of a hospital 
changed so much as to make children say,
											'I want to be hospitalised 
to see Bailey'.
											With Bailey,
kids can double their fun.
											With Bailey,
kids can share tears and fears.
											Most children are discharged 
from hospital safe and sound.
											But sadly, some kids have to 
leave this world forever,
											and Bailey sometimes sleeps with them 
till just before their last moments.
											We say 'You know, Bailey's with you',
											'It's warm, isn't?' to kids.
											The time goes on sadly 
but warmly.
											We sometimes attend a funeral 
for children.
											When parents have to close the lid 
of their own child's coffin,
											can you imagine how they feel?
											In fact every family says
											'We were really happy 
to have Bailey with us'.
											They always say that.
											'Before Bailey, the hospital stay 
had been just so heart-wrenching'.
											'With Bailey our kid's life 
changed so much'.
											These are what bereaved families 
said to us.
											A family who lost their child 
will reflect on their child everyday,
											through their long span of life.
											Remembering their child 
as 'a poor soul who went through
											so many painful operations;
or remembering their child
											as 'a laughing kid sleeping 
with Bailey just before death;
											their feelings are completely different,
aren't they?
											We wish to make 
a small portion of happiness
											in their heartbreaking memory.
											We wish the bereaved family remember 
as many smiles of their kid as possible.
											The Facility Dog Programme 
is not an option,
											but necessity for hospital care,
that's what I strongly feel about it.
											Japan's medical care is said to be 
the highest in the world.
											Not just curing disease,
but also having an environment
											for healing disease more proactively 
is necessary, I think.
											For patients,
they can't have too much fun.
											There are a lot of facility dogs 
in Europe and the US,
											but in Japan we have only two.
											I would like to have facility dogs 
as a standard in Japanese hospitals
											and make Japanese hospitals 
a fun place to be in,
											even for patients 
who have medical conditions.
											So many children who passed away 
are watching for us from heaven.
											For those kids, I would like to 
make the Japanese medical front a place
											where I can be proud to say,
'Hey, it's a good hospital, isn't it?'
											(Applause)
