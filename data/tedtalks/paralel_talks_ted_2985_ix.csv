											I suppose I owe you an explanation.
											I've been working on a project for the last six years
											adapting children's poetry to music.
											And that's a poem by Charles Edward Carryl,
											who was a stockbroker in New York City
											for 45 years,
											but in the evenings, he wrote nonsense for his children.
											And this book was one of the most famous books in America
											for about 35 years.
											""The Sleepy Giant,"" which is the song that I just sang,
											is one of his poems.
											Now, we're going to do
											other poems for you,
											and here's a preview of some of the poets.
											This is Rachel Field,
											Robert Graves —
											a very young Robert Graves —
											Christina Rossetti.
											Ghosts, right?
											Have nothing to say to us,
											obsolete,
											gone —
											not so.
											What I really enjoyed about this project
											is reviving these people's words.
											Taking them off the dead, flat pages.
											Bringing them to life,
											bringing them to light.
											So, what we're going to do next
											is a poem that was written by Nathalia Crane.
											Nathalia Crane was a little girl from Brooklyn.
											When she was 10 years old in 1927,
											she published her first book of poems
											called ""The Janitor's Boy.""
											Here she is.
											And here's her poem.
									","
											Supongo que les debo una explicación.
											He estado trabajando en un proyecto los últimos 6 años
											adaptando poesía infantil a la música.
											Y ese es un poema de Charles Edward Carryl,
											que fue corredor de bolsa de Nueva York
											durante 45 años
											pero por las tardes escribía disparates para sus hijos.
											Este libro fue uno de los más famosos de EE.UU.
											durante unos 35 años.
											""El Gigante Dormido"", canción que acabo de cantar,
											es uno de sus poemas.
											Ahora vamos a hacer
											otros poemas.
											He aquí una vista previa de algunos poetas.
											Esta es Rachel Field,
											Robert Graves,
											un Robert Graves muy joven
											Christina Rossetti.
											Fantasmas, ¿verdad?
											no tienen nada para decirnos.
											Obsoletos.
											Se fueron.
											No es así.
											Lo que he disfrutado en este proyecto
											fue revivir las palabras de esta gente
											despegándolos de las páginas muertas, planas,
											dotándolos de vida
											sacándolos a la luz.
											Bien, lo que vamos a hacer ahora
											es un poema escrito por Nathalia Crane.
											Nathalia Crane era una niñita de Brooklyn.
											A los 10 años, en 1927,
											publicó su primer poemario
											titulado ""El niño del portero""
											Aquí está ella.
											Y este es su poema.
									","
											Sanırım size bir açıklama borçluyum.
											Altı yıldır çocuk şiiirini
											müziğe uyarlayan bir proje üzerinde çalışıyorum.
											Ve bu Charles Edward Carryl'den bir şiir,
											kendisi 45 yıl New York'ta
											borsacı olarak çalıştı,
											fakat akşamları, çocuklar için anlamsız şiirler yazdı.
											Ve bu kitap yaklaşık 35 yıldır,
											Amerika'daki en ünlü kitaplardan biridir.
											""Uykucu Dev"", az önce söylediğim şarkı,
											onun şiirlerinden biridir.
											Şimdi, diğer şiirleri de
											sizler için seslendireceğim.
											Ve işte bazı şairlerin ön tanıtımı.
											Bu Rachel Field,
											Robert Graves,
											ve çok genç Robert Graves,
											Christina Rossetti.
											Hayaletler, evet,
											bize söyleyecek hiçbir şeyi yok.
											Demode.
											Yıpranmış.
											Öyle değil.
											Bu projede gerçekten hoşuma giden
											insanların bu sözlerini gündeme getirmek,
											onları ölmüş, düz sayfalardan çıkarmak,
											canlandırmak,
											gün ışığına çıkarmak.
											Şimdi söyleyeceğimiz
											Nathalia Crane tarafından yazılmış bir şiir.
											Nathalia Crane Brooklyn'li küçük bir kızdı.
											10 yaşındayken, 1972'de,
											""Kapıcının oğlu"" adlı
											ilk şiir kitabını çıkardı.
											İşte bu.
											Ve işte onun şiiri.

											Je crois que je vous dois une explication.
											Cela fait six ans que je travaille sur un projet
											qui consiste à adapter de la poésie pour enfants à la musique.
											Et ce que vous venez d'entendre est un poème de Charles Edward Carryl
											qui était courtier à New York
											pendant 45 ans,
											mais le soir, il écrivait des textes saugrenus pour ses enfants.
											Et cet ouvrage fut l'un des plus célèbres aux États-Unis
											pendant environ 35 ans.
											La chanson ""The Sleepy Giant"" (""Le Géant Ensommeillé""), que je viens de vous chanter,
											est l'un de ses poèmes.
											Maintenant nous allons vous interpréter
											d'autre poèmes.
											Voici un aperçu de quelques-uns des auteurs.
											Voici Rachel Field,
											Robert Graves,
											un très jeune Robert Graves,
											Christina Rossetti.
											Les fantômes, n'est-ce pas...
											ne nous apprennent rien.
											Obsolètes.
											Disparus.
											Pas du tout.
											Ce qui m'a vraiment plu dans ce projet,
											c'est de faire revivre les mots de ces personnes,
											de les retirer de ces pages mortes, et à plat,
											de les ramener à la vie,
											à la lumière.
											Notre prochain morceau
											est un poème composé par Nathalia Crane.
											Nathalia Crane était une petite fille de Brooklyn.
											C'est à 10 ans, en 1927,
											qu'elle publia son premier recueil de poèmes
											intitulé ""The Janitor's Boy"" (""Le Fils du Concierge"").
											La voici.
											Et voici son poème.
									","
											Ich vermute, dass ich Ihnen eine Erklärung schulde.
											Ich arbeite seit etwa sechs Jahren an diesem Projekt,
											Kindergedichte in Musik zu verwandeln.
											Dies war ein Gedicht von Charles Edward Carryl,
											der ein in New York City Börsenmakler
											über 45 Jahre war,
											aber an den Abenden Unsinn für seine Kinder verfasste.
											Und diese Buch war eines der berühmtesten Bücher in Amerika
											für etwa 35 Jahre.
											""The Sleepy Giant"" , das Lied, welches ich gerade sang,
											ist eines der Gedichte.
											Wir werden Ihnen
											weitere Gedichte vorstellen.
											Hier ein kurzer Überblick über einige der Dichter.
											Dies sind Rachel Field,
											Robert Graves,
											ein sehr junger Robert Graves,
											Christina Rossetti.
											Geister, richtig,
											haben uns nicht zu sagen.
											Überholt.
											Weg.
											Nicht ganz.
											Was ich in diesem Projekt wirklich mochte,
											war die Worte dieser Menschen wiederzubeleben,
											sie von den Toten zu nehmen und
											sie zum Leben zu erwecken,
											sie ins Licht zu rücken.
											Was wir Ihnen als nächstes präsentieren,
											ist ein Gedicht von Nathalia Crane.
											Nathalia Crane war ein kleines Mädchen aus Brooklyn.
											Als die 10 Jahre alt war, 1927,
											veröffentlichte sie ihren ersten Gedichtband
											mit dem Titel ""The Janitor's Boy""
											Hier ist sie.
											Und hier ihr Gedicht.

											The next poem is ""If No One Ever Marries Me.""
											It was written by Laurence Alma-Tadema.
											She was the daughter of a very, very famous Dutch painter
											who had made his fame in England.
											He went there after the death
											of his wife of smallpox
											and brought his two young children.
											One was his daughter, Laurence.
											She wrote this poem when she was
											18 years old in 1888,
											and I look at it as kind of a
											very sweet feminist manifesto
											tinged with a little bit of defiance
											and a little bit of resignation and regret.
									","
											El próximo poema es ""Si nadie jamás se casa conmigo"".
											Fue escrito por Laurence Alma-Tadema.
											Era la hija de un pintor holandés muy, muy famoso
											que había hecho su fama en Inglaterra.
											Él fue allí luego de la muerte
											de su esposa por la viruela
											y llevó a sus dos hijos.
											Una era su hija Laurence.
											Ella escribió este poema a sus
											18 años, en 1888,
											y yo lo veo como una suerte de
											manifiesto feminista muy dulce
											con un toque de desafío
											y un poquito de resignación y pesar.
									","
											Sıradaki şiir ""Ya Hiç Kimse Benimle Evlenmezse"".
											Laurence Alma-Tadema tarafından yazılmış.
											Ününü İngiltere'de yapmış çok çok ünlü
											Hollandalı bir ressamın kızı.
											Eşinin çiçek hastalığından ölmesi üzerine
											oraya gitti
											ve iki genç çocuğunu da birlikte götürdü.
											Biri kızı Laurence'ti.
											Bu şiiri 1888 yılında,
											18 yaşındayken yazdı,
											ve ben bu şiire bir çeşit
											çok tatlı feminist bir manifesto olarak bakıyorum
											bir parça isyan
											ve bir parça teslimiyet ve pişmanlık içeren.
									","
											Le prochain poème s'intitule ""Si personne jamais ne m'épouse.""
											Il a été composé par Laurence Alma-Tadema.
											Elle fut la fille d'un peintre hollandais très, très célèbre,
											qui l'était devenu en Angleterre.
											Il est allé là-bas après le décès
											de sa femme, morte de la variole
											et il amena avec lui ses deux jeunes enfants.
											Dont l'une, sa fille Laurence,
											A composé ce poème quand elle avait
											18 ans, en 1888,
											et ce poème est pour moi
											une sorte de manifeste féministe très tendre
											avec une touche de défiance
											et un peu de résignation et de regret.
									","
											Das nächste Gedicht ist ""Wenn mich niemand heiraten wird"".
											Es wurde von Laurence Alma-Tadema geschrieben.
											Sie war die Tochter eines sehr, sehr berühmten dänischen Malers,
											der in England bekannt wurde.
											Er ging dorthin nach dem Pocken-Tod
											seiner Frau
											und brachte seine zwei Kinder mit sich.
											Eines war seine Tochetr Laurence.
											Sie schrieb das Gedicht als sie
											18 Jahre alt war, 1888,
											und ich sehe es als eine Art
											feministisches Manifest
											gefärbt mit ein wenig Herausforderung
											und ein wenig Resignation und Bedauern.

											I became very curious about the poets
											after spending six years with them,
											and started to research their lives,
											and then decided to write a book about it.
											And the burning question about Alma-Tadema
											was: Did she marry?
											And the answer was no,
											which I found in the London Times archive.
											She died alone in 1940
											in the company of her books and her dear friends.
											Gerard Manley Hopkins,
											a saintly man.
											He became a Jesuit.
											He converted from his Anglican faith.
											He was moved to by the Tractarian Movement,
											the Oxford Movement, otherwise known as —
											and he became a Jesuit priest.
											He burned all his poetry at the age of 24
											and then did not write another poem for at least seven years
											because he couldn't rectify the life of a poet
											with the life of a priest.
											He died typhoid fever
											at the age of 44, I believe,
											43 or 44.
											At the time, he was teaching classics
											at Trinity College in Dublin.
											A few years before he died,
											after he had resumed writing poetry,
											but in secret,
											he confessed to a friend in a letter
											that I found when I was doing my research:
											""I've written a verse.
											It is to explain death to a child,
											and it deserves a piece of plain-song music.""
											And my blood froze when I read that
											because I had written the plain-song music
											130 years after he'd written the letter.
											And the poem is called, ""Spring and Fall.""
									","
											Me dieron mucha curiosidad los poetas
											después de pasar 6 años con ellos
											comencé a investigar sus vidas
											y después decidí escribir un libro sobre eso.
											Y la pregunta candente sobre Alma-Tadema
											era: ¿Se casó?
											Y la respuesta es no, según lo que
											encontré en el archivo del London Times.
											Murió sola, en 1940,
											en compañía de sus libros y sus queridos amigos.
											Gerard Manley Hopkins,
											un hombre piadoso.
											Se hizo jesuita.
											Se convirtió desde la fe anglicana
											por el movimiento tractariano
											también conocido como movimiento de Oxford
											y se convirtió en un sacerdote jesuita.
											Quemó toda su poesía a la edad de 24 años
											y no volvió a escribir otro poema hasta al menos siete años después
											porque no podía alinear la vida de poeta
											con la de sacerdote.
											Murió de fiebre tifoidea
											a los 44 años, creo,
											43 o 44.
											En ese entonces estaba enseñando clásicos
											en el Trinity College, de Dublín.
											Unos años antes de su muerte
											luego de haber retomado la escritura de poesía,
											pero en secreto,
											confesó a un amigo en una carta,
											que encontré cuando yo estaba investigando,
											""He escrito un verso.
											Es para explicarle la muerte a un niño.
											Y se merece un poco de musicalización"".
											Se me heló la sangre cuando leí eso
											porque yo escribí la musicalización
											130 años después de que él escribiera la letra.
											Y el poema se llamó ""Primavera y Otoño"".
									","
											Onlarla altı yıl geçirdikten sonra,
											şairlerin hayatını çok merak etmeye başladım,
											ve hayatlarını araştırmaya başladım,
											ve bu konuda bir kitap yazmaya karar verdim.
											Alma-Tadema hakkındaki en önemli soru
											""evlendi mi acaba?"" oldu.
											Cevap ""hayır""dı,
											London Times arşivinde bulduğum.
											1940 yılında kitapları ve
											sevgili arkadaşları eşliğinde yalnız öldü.
											Gerard Manley Hopkins,
											aziz gibi bir adam.
											Bir Cizvit oldu.
											Anglikan inancından döndü.
											Traktarian haraketi sebebiyle
											Oxford tarafına geçti, ya da başka bir deyişle
											Cizvit bir rahip oldu.
											24 yaşında tüm şiirlerini yaktı
											ve ondan sonra en az yedi yıl hiç şiir yazmadı
											çünkü bir şairin yaşamını
											bir rahibin yaşamı ile arındıramazdı.
											Tifodan kaynaklanan yüksek ateşten öldü
											44 yaşında, sanırım,
											43 ya da 44.
											O sırada,
											Dublin'deki Trinity Üniversitesinde klasikleri öğretiyordu.
											Ölmeden birkaç yıl önce,
											yeniden şiir yazmaya başladıktan sonra,
											fakat gizlice,
											bir arkadaşına yazdığı mektupta itiraf etti
											bu mektubu araştırmalarımı yaparken buldum.
											""Bir dörtlük yazdım.
											Bir çocuğa ölümü anlatmak için.
											Ve bir kilise müziğine layık.""
											Okuduğumda kanım donuyor
											çünkü mektubu yazdıktan 130 yıl sonra
											o müziği ben yaptım.
											Şiirin adı ""İlkbahar ve Güz.""

											que j'ai trouvée lorsque je faisais mes recherches :
											""J'ai écrit un verset
											pour expliquer la mort à un enfant.
											Et il mérite d'être chanté en musique.""
											Et mon sang se glaça quand j'ai lu cela
											car j'avais composé la musique pour chanter ce texte
											130 ans après qu'il ait écrit la lettre.
											Et le poème s'intitule ""Le printemps et l'automne.""

											Gerard Many Hopkins,
											ein heiliger Mann.
											Er wurde Jesuit.
											Er konvertierte von seinem angelikanischen Glauben.
											Er schloss sich der traktarianischen Bewegung an,
											der Oxford Bewegung unter der sie auch bekannt ist
											und wurde ein Jesuitenpriester.
											Er verbrannte all seine Dichtungen im Alter von 24
											und er schrieb erst mehr als sieben Jahre später wieder ein Gedicht
											weil er das Leben eines Dichters nicht
											mit dem Leben eines Priesters vereinbaren konnte.
											Er starb an Typhus
											im Alter von 44, glaube ich,
											43 oder 44.
											Zu dieser Zeit lehrte er die Klassiker
											am Trinity College in Dublin.
											Einige Jahre vor seinem Tod,
											nach dem er zur Dichtkunst zurückgekehrt war,
											aber nur geheim,
											gestand er einem Freund in einem Brief,
											welchen ich bei meinen Recherchen fand.
											""Ich habe einen Vers geschrieben.
											Er erklärt den Tod für ein Kind.
											Und er verdient Stück einfacher Musik.""
											Mir gefror mein Blut als ich das las
											weil ich eine einfache Musik geschrieben hatte
											130 Jahre nachdem er diesem Brief schrieb..
											Das Gedicht heißt ""Frühlung und Herbst""
