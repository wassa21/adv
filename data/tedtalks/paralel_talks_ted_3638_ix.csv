											Afrobeat is a force,

											""One Dance,"" written by Wizkid,
performed by Wizkid and Drake.
											""Unforgettable"" by French Montana.
											For those who know or don't know,
French Montana is Moroccan.
											Artists who the world
has normally considered as mainstream
											are now realizing
they're late to the party.
											And they are knocking on the door,
											and because we are good people,
we are going to let them in.

											Pour ceux qui le savent ou non,
French Montana est marocain.
