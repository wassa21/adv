en su viaje a través del Atlántico
											pasó por el infierno y sobrevivió.
											Ella está exhausta,
											es una reina,
											y en esta sección,
verán que está triunfante.
											Lo consiguió,
											y ella está, en ese último paso que hace,
											superando cualquier cosa negativa,
											con su tremenda fuerza.
											Y en el paso final, cava en la tierra
											y alcanza el cielo...
											porque está despejando
el espacio para el próxima viaje.
											Lo interpreté en 1971,
											y aún seguimos despejando el espacio.
									","
											Ma première performance
											fut épuisante physiquement
et émotionnellement.
											Je n'avais encore jamais exécuté
sa totalité d'un seul coup.
											Le ballet dure 16 minutes.
											Il parle d'une femme fière
qui est descendue et revenue des enfers,
											de sa traversée de l'Atlantique.
											Elle est épuisée,
											c'est une reine
											et dans cet extrait,
vous constaterez qu'elle triomphe.
											Elle a réussi
											et, au moment du dernier mouvement,
											elle anéantit tout ce qui est négatif
											de sa force extraordinaire.
											Le dernier pas, elle s'enracine au sol
											et lève les bras au ciel...
											car elle prépare son prochain voyage.
											Je l'ai dansé en 1971
											et nous continuons de nous préparer.

											Now let me leave you
with one last thought.
											Here we are, in the 21st century,
											still fighting for civil rights.
											Not a day goes by
											that we are not made aware
of the struggle that continues.
											I believe that dance
can elevate our human experience
											beyond words.
											And when you're sitting in the dark,
											in the theater,
											having a personal experience,
											you don't feel blocked or misunderstood.
											You feel open,
											alive,
											and, we hope,
											inspired.
									","
											Permítanme dejarlos
con una última reflexión.
											Aquí estamos, en el siglo XXI,
											aún luchando por derechos civiles.
											No pasa un día
											sin que nos demos cuenta
de que la lucha continúa.
											Creo que bailar puede 
elevar nuestra experiencia humana
											más allá de las palabras.
											Y cuando están sentados en la oscuridad,
											en el teatro,
											teniendo una experiencia personal,
											no se sienten bloqueados e incomprendidos.
											Se sienten expuestos,
											vivos,
											y, esperamos,
											inspirados.
									","
											J'aimerais vous quitter
avec un dernier mot.
											Nous voilà maintenant au XXIe siècle
											et nous continuons de nous battre
pour nos droits civils.
											Il n'y a pas un jour
											sans que nous soyons libérés
de cette lutte continue.
											Je suis convaincue que la danse
peut élever notre expérience humaine
											au-delà des mots.
											Et quand vous serez assis dans l'obscurité
											de la salle de théâtre,
											vivant votre expérience personnelle,
											vous ne vous sentirez pas
entravés ou incompris.
											Vous vous sentirez ouverts,
											vivants
											et, nous l'espérons,
											inspirés.
