supposed to see that picture.

											I definitely was not
comfortable in my body.
											I didn't like it.
											I didn't understand why I had muscles.
											And I stopped lifting weights.
											I was like, I'm not going to do this.
											But then after I won the US Open,
											I realized that my body helped me
reach goals that I wanted to reach,
											and I wanted to be happy with it,
											and I was so appreciative of it.
											I'm always healthy.
											I'm really fortunate and superblessed,
											and I felt like not only
am I happy with my body,
											but I want other people
and other young girls
											that have experienced
what I've experienced
											to be happy with themselves.
											So whatever people say —
											masculine, whatever,
too much, too little —
											I'm OK with it as long as I love myself.
									","
											İlginç bir durum. Çünkü,
kamuoyunun gözü önünde
											büyüyen genç bir kızsanız,
											dikkatli bakışların odağı oluyorsunuz.
											Ergen yaşlarda bir kadın olarak
											vücudumla hiç barışık değildim.
											Sevmiyordum görünüşümü.
											Kaslarımın olmasını yadırgıyordum.
											Ağırlık çalışmayı bıraktım.
											Buna bir son vereceğim diyordum.
											Ama Amerika Açık'ı kazanınca,
											vücudumun, hedeflerime ulaşmamı
sağladığını fark ettim
											ve onunla barışık olmak istedim.
											Vücudumun değerini anladım.
											Hep sağlıklı biriyim.
											Gerçekten şanslı biriyim.
											Bir tek ben değil,
benim yaşadıklarımı
											yaşayan diğer insanlar,
diğer genç kızlar da
											vücuduyla mutlu,
kendileriyle barışık olmalı
											diye düşünüyorum.
											İnsanlar ne derse desin,
											maskülen ya da her neyse,
çok fazla, çok az vb.
											Kendimi sevdiğim sürece
tüm söylenenlerle barışığım.

											SW: I hate to lose, but I think
losing has brought me here today.
											The only reason I am who I am
is because of my losses,
											and some of them are extremely painful,
											but I wouldn't take any of them away,
											because every time I lose,
											it takes a really long time
for me to lose again
											because I learn so much from it.
											And I encourage everyone that I talk to —
											I'm like, listen, if you lose
or if something happens —
											not in sports —
in business or in school —
											learn from it.
											Don't live in the past,
live in the present,
