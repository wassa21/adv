",What playing Monopoly with real money taught me about my kids—and humanity,Adam Carroll,15:41,"psychology,finance,family,money,decision-making,gaming"
"
											I recently completed an unsanctioned,
unsupervised psychological experiment
											on my children,
											(Laughter)
											the premise of which was
$10,000 in cash on the kitchen table
											and a sign next to it
that said 'Don't touch the money yet!',
											and before I dive into it,
											you should know that we
are a game-playing family.
											We play ball games, board games,
dice games, card games,
											all sorts of games,
											but the games that my children love
to play most are games like Monopoly,
											and when they play Monopoly,
they play marathon games of Monopoly
											that last hours and hours
over days of play.
											Each of my kids has a unique strategy
and personality when they play Monopoly.
											My daughter, who is 11,
she is always the dog.
											She plays entirely for Chance
and Community Chest cards;
											(Laughter)
											you can say that she uses
the 'luck' strategy.
											My 9-year-old son is always the car -
a very strategic player.
											He buys all of the Railroads
and all of the Utilities
											and then proceeds to put houses and hotels
on the most expensive properties -
											very savvy.
											And then his younger brother,
who is seven,
											he buys everything that he lands on
with no exception,
											which is fitting because he
is the wheelbarrow.
											Now, before I tell you
how my experiment unfolded,
											I have to share an observation
that led me to the creation of it.
											One Monopoly marathon, Saturday morning,
I was playing with my kids
											and noticed that they were all playing
just outside of the rules of the game.
											So they were doing things
like buying each other out of jail
											and lending each other money
to buy properties,
											and I found myself going, 'Guys,
this is not how this game is played!'
											to which they'd say, 'Dad, it's fine!
We just want her on the board with us',
											or, 'He can pay me back
at the end of the game,
											when he's flush with cash',
											and I'm thinking again,
'What am I teaching these kids?'
											So, I started watching
how they were playing -
											listening to their banter, getting a feel
for how they were making decisions -
											and I had this thought:
											'What if they're playing this way
because the money isn't real?'
											It's a concept I've been reading a lot
about, lately, 'Financial abstraction',
											the notion that when money
becomes more and more of an idea,
											less tangible and therefore more abstract,
											it changes the way we interact with it
on a regular basis,
											and there's anecdotal evidence
of abstraction everywhere around us.
											All you have to do is listen carefully
to people who say,
											'I loaned my child
or grandchild the phone,
											and a month later,
											all these errant in-app charges
showed up on my bill.'
											In 2014, Apple reimbursed customers
for in-app purchases that were unapproved,
											mostly by children,
to the tune of $32.5 million.
											This is in a US FTC settlement.
											In the documentation,
											it said it was just too easy for kids
to make an in-app purchase.
											The Imagineers at Disney were charged
with making the parks 'frictionless' -
											is what they called it -
											so they invested a billion dollars
in a MagicBand.
											It's a wearable device that functions
as your room key, your park ticket,
											and your ID and wallet
when you're on park property.
											So if your child wants a set of ears
and a dessert in the Magic Kingdom,
											'bibbidi-bobbidi-boo' -
											(Laughter)
											your vacation just cost a whole lot more,
											magically.
											Magically.
											Lastly, I had a conversation
with some teenagers
											who told me that $100,000 a year
really wasn't that much money.
											I said, 'Really?
Why do you think that?'
											They said, 'Well, we both have $500,000
in our ATM machines on Grand Theft Auto',
											(Laughter)
											which is a very popular
and somewhat sketchy video game.
											So as I'm playing with my kids
and I'm watching them play,
											listening to them talk,
											I thought, 'What if the money
were real on the table?
											Would they play differently?'
											And so I calculated quickly on the box,
											'How much would it take
in capital, in currency,
											to play a physical game
of Monopoly with my kids
											so that they actually tangibly
got to feel the money in their hands?'
											And I estimated, for four or five players,
it's about $10,000.
											So one Friday, I stopped at the bank,
											I got all the denominations of bills
on a Monopoly board
											with the exception
of a $500 bill - hard to get -
											and on Sunday, I rounded the family up
for a high-stakes game of Monopoly,
											(Laughter)
											where the winner takes all.
											All of $20, by the way.
											All of $20.
											You have never seen kids' eyes
light up the way mine did
											when I handed each of them
$1,500 in starter capital,
											and you have never seen
anyone's eyes light up like my wife's
											when I took it back on Monday.
											(Laughter)
											All of it.
											Our marathon game
only lasted two and a half hours -
											far shorter and more strategic
than most of the games they normally play.
											True to my hypothesis,
											two of my three kids
actually played differently;
											my daughter still played the 'luck' card.
											She was the first one bankrupted,
											(Laughter)
											and she happily retired
to the living room to read a book.
											My youngest son, the wheelbarrow,
did not buy everything he landed on;
											instead, he carefully calculated
											how many rolls away he was
from one of his brother's properties
											and how much he would owe his brother
if he landed on said property,
											and made his decisions based on that.
											In effect, having real money on the table
and a cash prize at the end
											made him more conservative.
											And my middle son - very strategic -
											still bought all of the Railroads,
still bought all of the Utilities,
											but did not buy Boardwalk and Park Place
or Mayfair and Park Lane,
											but instead, he put hotels immediately
on Oriental and Baltic Avenue,
											or Coventry and Leicester Square
on the UK version.
											When I asked him why,
in his own words, he said,
											'Dad, they're just
more affordable properties.'
											(Laughter)
											At which point, I cried a tear of pride.
											(Laughter)
											So he got it!
											In the end, my son finished
with 28 properties,
											more cash than he'd ever seen
and held in his entire life,
											and he now knows the meaning
of the phrase 'making it rain'.
											(Laughter)
											Look how happy he is,
											(Laughter)
											and how annoyed
his brother and sister are.
											In the confines of my experiment,
there is an idea worth spreading,
											and it is this:
											I believe kids today
											are being raised in a world
where money is no longer real;
											it's actually an illusion,
but it has very real consequences.
											Peter Drucker, famed leadership guru,
											said banking and finance industries today
											are less about money
and more about information,
											and yet young people today
don't get that information;
											they don't get the experiences
of money, early on.
											Three researchers from
the Centre for Creative Leadership,
											in a study done two decades ago
that's been replicated many, many times,
											they interviewed over 200 executives
											in a report called
'Key events in executives' lives'.
											In this report, they found
											that of the 200 top-level executives
who were the top of their game,
											all of them had similar characteristics.
											One of them was
that early on in their career,
											they had been thrust
into a leadership role
											that required them to make decisions
that had serious consequences.
											They also had a mentor in place
that helped them appreciate the lessons
											they were supposed to learn
from those experiences.
											The study created a leadership framework
that said, in essence,
											that someone with potential,
											if given the opportunity to engage
in strategically relevant experiences
											and given the ability to learn the lessons
from those experiences,
											would have a higher likelihood of success
in their career in a leadership capacity.
											Now if you took that study framework
and my $10,000 experiment
											and looked at it
through the kaleidoscope,
											you would get a statement like this:
											if kids are given financially-relevant
experiences in their life
											and someone is there to help them
learn the lessons from those experiences,
											they have a higher likelihood
											of achieving financial
success later in life,
											and in my humble opinion,
											they need to have them early,
and they need to have them often.
											We under this not-so-subtle societal shift
in the way that we pay each other, today.
											It's estimated there are trillions
of dollars circling the globe
											in our global economy every single day,
											yet only four percent of that money
is actually in coin or currency.
											The rest is all digital, data packets,
ones and zeroes,
											and today's digital-native youth -
											they don't see people paying
with cash or cheques.
											In fact, if ever you're in a line,
											and someone in front
pulls out their chequebook to pay,
											you are liable to say to yourself,
'Really, a chequebook?
											This is going to take forever.'
											You're laughing because it's true.
											The currency of today is digital.
											Many of these kids equate spending
with credit and debit cards,
											with Google Wallet and Paypal and Zap.
											All of these are what they
equate spending to,
											and by the way,
											I am not pooh-poohing
the technological advancements
											in payment technology today -
											far from it.
											I think tokenisation and randomisation
and biometrics are the wave of the future.
											The first time that I used Apple Pay,
it was like showing the caveman fire.
											It was amazing.
											But what snapped me back to reality
was hearing my son behind me say,
											'I sure wish I had a phone
so I could buy stuff.'
											(Laughter)
											You see, money, to a young person,
is somewhat abstract, anyway,
											and when we further the abstraction
by waving a MagicBand
											or putting our phone over a sensor
and giving the thumbprint,
											all it does is further the abstraction.
											It's a recipe for financial disaster
later in life to the uneducated
											because, to a young person,
they see money as limitless
											because they have no concept
of the backend
											until it comes around
to bite them in the back end.
											I've seen this firsthand
in my work with university students -
											young people who borrow
and spend untold amounts of money,
											having no concept or understanding
of the increase in payments,
											the decrease in lifestyle,
and the challenges they'll face later on.
											In the UK and the US,
student debt is ballooning problem.
											In the US, we're at $1.2 trillion
in student loan debt,
											second only to mortgage debt in the US.
											One in three students is delinquent.
											One in five is in default.
											It's a huge problem,
											and the reason that this is concerning
for all of us as a global economy is this:
											Dun &amp; Bradstreet found
that people spend 12 to 18 percent more
											when using credit cards over cash.
											They have yet to do a study
											how much more we'll spend
with a MagicBand or a phone,
											but I can imagine
it would be 15 to 20 percent,
											or 18 to 25 percent,
											and all you need to do
is read the headlines
											in the newspapers and magazines
across the world today.
											Places like The Guardian,
The Washington Post, Fortune, Forbes -
											these are the headlines we're seeing:
											'New consumer debt reaching
a seven-year high' in the UK,
											'Consumer debt hitting an all-time high'
in the US, 'Choking on credit card debt',
											'The credit card debt crisis:
the next economic domino'.
											It's what happens when people overspend
											and get in over their head with money.
											Unfortunately, The Money Charity says
that in the UK right now,
											one person every five minutes
and three seconds
											is either declared insolvent or bankrupt.
											To put this into perspective,
since I started speaking today,
											two people in this country
have declared bankruptcy.
											In the UK, Demos.org says
that Americans aged 25 to 34
											have the second highest rate
of bankruptcy.
											25-year-olds.
											Everyone's question should be,
											'Why? Why is this happening?',
											and in my simplistic view, it is this:
											because the money they're spending
isn't real - it's an abstraction.
											So to stem this tide
with the next generation,
											we have to bring them up to understand
that they are living in a world
											where they have to make
very real money decisions,
											in a world money is largely an illusion
but has very, very real consequences.
											Because I want your children and mine
to be super successful financially,
											consider any of the following:
											If you are going
to spend money on children,
											give them a set amount of money
and let them spend it.
											Let them tangibly feel the money
go through their hands.
											Let them succeed or fail
with minor consequences
											so that later in life,
when they're making the major decisions,
											they understand there are
major consequences that go along.
											For older kids, it's this:
											set a budgeted amount for school clothes,
supplies and what-have-you,
											give them that amount,
											and when they are
done spending it, it's done.
											And here's the key; they get to spend it
with your subtle guidance,
											your subtle mentorship,
your subtle supervision,
											and whether you call it an allowance,
you call it commission for chores
											or you call it a weekly stipend,
											every single child,
from the age of five on up,
											needs to be given some tangible amount
of money on a weekly basis
											so that they understand how to function
in a cashless society someday.
											Better to teach the young
the habit of saving
											when they have a little bit
of money to save
											than try to teach savings
when they have no money
											because they're in over their head.
											I met an American named José.
											He was a 20-year-old student
at an American university.
											He was the child
of two Cuban-born parents.
											At the age of 15, his parents told him,
											'José, we will give you food,
we will give you shelter
											and we will give you $50 a month,
but the rest is up to you.'
											I asked him, 'What was that like?'
											He said, 'Clothing, toiletries,
school supplies, entertainment, gas -
											it was all on me.
											I resented my parents for a year.
											But you know what?
											I realised it was the single best thing
they could have ever done for me.'
											When I met José at 20,
											he was on a full-ride scholarship
at the university he attended.
											He had $20,000 saved in a savings account
from working part-time in high school,
											and this kid exuded financial prowess
and unmistakable leadership potential.
											At the heart of my message today is this:
											it does not take a $10,000 board game
											and it doesn't take cutting kids off
financially to make a difference.
											The first step is, honestly, quite easy.
											It's about educating the next generation
to make decisions in a world
											where money is largely an illusion
but has very, very real consequences,
											and the reason it's so important for all
of us, as a global society, to do this
											is this next generation coming up
											will inherit the global economy
that we are handing to them,
											and we will precariously place it
on their shoulders.
											We owe it to them to set them up
for financial success.
											Thank you.
											(Applause)
											Thanks.

											Recientemente realicé un experimento 
psicológico no autorizado y no supervisado
											con mis hijos,
											(Risas)
											cuya premisa eran USD 10 000 en efectivo 
sobre la mesa de la cocina
											y un letrero al lado que decía:
""¡No toquen el dinero todavía!"",
											pero antes de empezar,
											deben saber que nuestra familia
disfruta de jugar.
											Jugamos juegos de pelota, juegos de mesa,
de dados, de cartas,
											todo tipo de juegos,
											pero los que más disfrutan mis hijos
son los juegos como Monopoly.
											Y cuando juegan al Monopoly,
juegan a un maratón de Monopoly
											que dura horas y horas 
durante varios días.
											Cada uno de mis hijos tiene su estrategia 
y personalidad únicas cuando lo juegan.
											Mi hija, que tiene 11 años,
siempre es el perro.
											Ella juega únicamente las cartas 
Fortuna y Arca comunal;
											(Risas)
											como pueden ver, ella usa 
la estrategia de la ""suerte"".
											Mi hijo de 9 años siempre es el auto;
es un jugador muy estratégico.
											Él compra los Ferrocarriles
y los Servicios públicos
											y luego procede a colocar casas y hoteles
en las propiedades más caras;
											muy sabio.
											Y luego, su hermano menor,
que tiene siete años,
											compra todo en donde cae, sin excepción,
											lo que es adecuado
porque él es la carretilla.
											Ahora bien, antes de decirles
cómo se desarrolló mi experimento,
											tengo que compartir una observación
que me llevó a crearlo.
											Un sábado por la mañana, jugando 
con mis hijos un maratón de Monopoly
											noté que estaban jugando
fuera de las reglas del juego.
											Y hacían cosas como sacarse 
los unos a los otros de la cárcel
											y prestarse dinero 
para comprar propiedades,
											y me encontré diciendo: ""¡Chicos,
así no se juega el juego!""
											Y ellos decían: ""¡Papá, está bien!
Solo queremos que ella esté con nosotros"".
											O: ""Me puede devolver el dinero
al final del juego,
											cuando tenga mucho efectivo"".
											Y, de nuevo, pensé: ""¿Qué les estoy 
enseñando a mis hijos?""
											Por lo que empecé a observar cómo jugaban
											—a escuchar sus bromas, a tratar de 
percibir cómo tomaban sus decisiones—
											y tuve este pensamiento:
											""¿Y si están jugando así
porque el dinero no es real?""
											Es un concepto sobre el cual leí mucho 
últimamente: ""abstracción financiera"",
											la noción de que cuando el dinero 
se vuelve más una idea,
											menos tangible, y por ende, más abstracto,
											cambia el modo en que interactuamos 
con él de manera regular,
											y hay pruebas anecdóticas de abstracción 
en todas partes a nuestro alrededor.
											Todo lo debemos hacer es escuchar 
lo que dice la gente:
											""Le presté el teléfono 
a mi hijo o a mi nieto,
											y un mes después,
											estos gastos en aplicaciones 
aparecieron en mi factura"".
											En el 2014, Apple reembolsó a los clientes
por compras de aplicaciones no autorizadas
											hechas mayormente por niños,
por un valor de USD 32,5 millones.
											Este es un acuerdo de la CFC en EE.UU.
											En la documentación
											decía que es muy fácil para los niños 
comprar las aplicaciones.
											A los Imagineers de Disney se les encargó
que hicieran los parques ""sin fricción""
											—es como lo llamaron—
											e invirtieron mil millones 
de dólares en una Magicband.
											Es un artefacto portátil que funciona como
llave del cuarto, entrada para el parque,
											identificación y billetera 
cuando uno está en el parque.
											Entonces, si su niño quiere unas orejas 
y un postre en el Magic Kingdom,
											—""bibidi, babidi, bu'""—
											(Risas)
											sus vacaciones cuestan mucho más,
											mágicamente.
											Mágicamente.
											Hace poco tuve una charla
con unos adolescentes
											que me dijeron que USD 100 000 al año
no era realmente mucho dinero.
											Yo les dije: ""¿No? ¿Por qué piensan eso?""
											Dijeron: ""Bien, ambos tenemos USD 500 000
en nuestros cajeros del Grand Theft Auto"",
											(Risas)
											que es un videojuego muy popular 
y algo superficial.
											Entonces, mientras jugaba con mis hijos
y los veía jugar,
											y los escuchaba hablando,
											pensé: ""¿Qué pasaría si el dinero
sobre la mesa fuera real?
											¿Jugarían diferente?""
											Y entonces calculé rápidamente la caja,
											""¿Cuánto se precisaría 
en capital, en efectivo,
											para jugar a un juego de Monopoly 
con mis hijos
											de manera que ellos pudieran 
palpar el dinero entre sus manos?""
											Y estimé que para cuatro o cinco jugadores
serían unos USD 10 000.
											Y así, un viernes pasé por el banco,
											conseguí todas las denominaciones 
de billetes del tablero de Monopoly
											a excepción del de USD 500
—es difícil de conseguir—
											y, el domingo, reuní a toda la familia
para un juego de Monopoly de alto riesgo,
											(Risas)
											donde el ganador se lo lleva todo.
											Todos los de USD 20, por cierto.
											Todos los de USD 20.
											Nunca vi unos ojos infantiles 
iluminarse como los de mis hijos
											cuando le di a cada uno
USD 1500 en capital inicial,
											y nunca vi los ojos de alguien
iluminarse como los de mi esposa
											cuando lo devolví el lunes.
											(Risas)
											Todo.
											Nuestro juego maratón
solo duró dos horas y media;
											fue mucho más corto y más estratégico
que los juegos que juegan normalmente.
											Fiel a mi hipótesis,
											dos de mis tres hijos jugaron diferente;
											mi hija todavía siguió jugando
la carta de la ""suerte"".
											Fue la primera en caer en bancarrota,
											(Risas)
											y se retiró felizmente al salón 
a leer un libro.
											Mi hijo más joven, la carretilla,
no compró todo en lo que caía;
											en cambio, calculó cuidadosamente
											a cuántos turnos se encontraba de alguna 
de las propiedades de sus hermanos
											y cuánto le debería a su hermano
si caía en dicha propiedad,
											y tomó sus decisiones basándose en eso.
											En efecto, el tener dinero real en la mesa
y un premio en efectivo al final
											lo hizo ser más conservador.
											Y mi hijo del medio —muy estratégico—
											siguió comprando todos los Ferrocarriles, 
y todos los Servicios públicos,
											pero no compró Boardwalk y Park Place,
o Mayfair y Park Lane,
											sino que inmediatamente puso hoteles 
en Avenida Oriental y Avenida Baltic,
											o Coventry y Leicester Square
en la versión del RU.
											Cuando le pregunté por qué,
me dijo, literalmente:
											""Papá, simplemente son 
propiedades más asequibles"".
											(Risas)
											En ese momento lloré de orgullo.
											(Risas)
											¡Lo entendió!
											Al final, mi hijo terminó
con 28 propiedades,
											y más efectivo del que nunca
había visto y sostenido en toda su vida,
											y ahora sabe el significado 
de la frase 'hacer llover [dinero]'
											(Risas)
											Miren que feliz está,
											(Risas)
											y cuán molestos están su hermana 
y su hermano.
											En los confines de mi experimento
hay una idea digna de difundir,
											y es esta:
											Creo que los niños
											están siendo criados en un mundo
donde el dinero ya no es real;
											es una ilusión, pero tiene 
consecuencias reales.
											Según Peter Ducker, gurú del liderazgo,
											los bancos e industrias financieras
											tienen más que ver con la información 
que con el dinero,
											pero la gente joven de hoy
no recibe esa información;
											no tienen experiencias tempranas 
con el dinero.
											Tres investigadores del Centro 
para el Liderazgo Creativo,
											en un estudio realizado hace dos décadas
que fue repetido muchas, muchas veces,
											entrevistaron a más de 200 ejecutivos
											en un informe llamado: ""Eventos clave
en la vida de los ejecutivos"".
											En el informe encontraron
											que de los 200 ejecutivos de alto nivel
que eran los mejores en su área,
											todos tenían características similares.
											Una de ellas era 
que al comienzo de su carrera,
											fueron propulsados a un rol de liderazgo
											que requería que tomaran decisiones
que tenían consecuencias serias.
											También tuvieron a un asesor que 
les ayudó a apreciar las lecciones
											que supuestamente aprenderían
de esas experiencias.
											El estudio creó un marco de liderazgo 
que decía, en esencia,
											que si alguien con potencial,
											recibe la oportunidad de participar 
en vivencias estratégicamente relevantes
											y la capacidad de aprender 
las lecciones de esas experiencias,
											tendrá una mayor probabilidad de éxito 
en su capacidad de liderazgo en su carrera.
											Bien, si tomamos ese marco de estudio
y mi experimento de los USD 10 000
											y lo miramos a través del caleidoscopio,
											obtendríamos un enunciado como este:
											si a los niños se les dan experiencias 
financieramente relevantes en su vida
											y hay alguien para ayudarlos a aprender
las lecciones de esas experiencias,
											tienen una gran posibilidad
											de alcanzar el éxito financiero
más tarde en su vida,
											y en mi humilde opinión,
											tienen que tenerlas temprano,
y tienen que tenerlas a menudo.
											Estamos en este cambio social poco sutil
en nuestras formas actuales de pago.
											Se estima que hay billones 
de dólares circulando por el globo
											cada día en nuestra economía global,
											y sin embargo solo un 4 % de ese dinero 
se encuentra en moneda o en divisas.
											El resto es todo digital, paquetes 
de datos, unos y ceros,
											y los jóvenes de hoy, nativos digitales,
											no ven a la gente pagar 
con efectivo o cheques.
											De hecho, si están en una cola,
											y alguien adelante saca 
una chequera para pagar,
											probablemente se dirán a sí mismos:
""¿En serio, una chequera?
											Esto va a ser una eternidad"".
											Se ríen porque es verdad.
											Las divisas de hoy son digitales.
											Muchos de estos chicos equiparan gastar
con las tarjetas de crédito y de débito,
											con el Google Wallet, Paypal y Zap.
											Para ellos es igual gastar
con cualquiera de estos,
											y, por cierto,
											no estoy desdeñando 
los avances tecnológicos
											de las tecnologías de pago;
											lejos de eso.
											La tokenisación, la aleatorización
y la biometría son la onda del futuro.
											La primera vez que usé el Apple Pay,
fue como mostrar el fuego a un troglodita.
											Fue maravilloso.
											Pero lo que me volvió a la realidad
fue escuchar a mi hijo diciendo:
											""Realmente desearía tener un teléfono
para poder comprar cosas"".
											(Risas)
											De todos modos, para una persona joven, 
el dinero es algo abstracto,
											y cuando profundizamos la abstracción
moviendo una Magicband
											o poniendo el teléfono y la huella 
digital sobre un sensor,
											todo esto favorece la abstracción.
											Es la receta para un posterior desastre 
financiero en la vida de los no educados,
											porque las personas jóvenes ven al dinero 
como algo ilimitado,
											ya que no tienen el concepto del final
											hasta que vuelve para morderlos 
en su parte trasera.
											He visto esto en mi trabajo con 
los estudiantes universitarios,
											gente joven que piden prestado y gastan 
grandes cantidades de dinero,
											sin tener el concepto o el conocimiento
sobre el incremento en los pagos,
											la declinación en el estilo de vida,
y los desafíos que enfrentarán más tarde.
											En el Reino Unido y EE.UU., la deuda 
estudiantil es un problema creciente.
											En EE.UU. la deuda de los préstamos para 
estudiantes es de unos USD 1,2 billones,
											solo siendo superadas en EE.UU.
por las deudas por hipotecas.
											Uno de cada tres estudiantes delinque.
											Uno de cada cinco están 
en incumplimiento de pago.
											Es un problema enorme,
											y esto nos concierne a todos
como economía global por esta razón:
											Según Dun &amp; Bradstreet, la gente 
gasta entre un 12 y un 18 % más
											al usar tarjetas de crédito 
en vez de efectivo.
											Aún deben hacer un estudio
											de cuánto más gastaremos 
con la Magicband o un teléfono,
											pero imagino que será 
entre un 15 y un 20 %,
											o entre un 18 y un 25 %,
											y todo lo que tienen que hacer
es leer los titulares
											de los periódicos y las revistas 
de hoy en el mundo.
											Así, en The Guardian,
The Washington Post, Fortune, Forbes,
											estos son los titulares que vemos:
											""Nueva deuda del consumidor alcanza 
su máximo en siete años"", en el RU;
											""Récord en las deudas de consumo"" en EE.UU.
""Asfixiante deuda de tarjetas de crédito"";
											""La crisis de la deuda de las tarjetas 
de crédito: el próximo dominó económico"".
											Esto pasa cuando la gente gasta de más
											y por encima de sus posibilidades.
											Lamentablemente, The Money Charity 
dice que actualmente en el Reino Unido
											cada cinco minutos y tres segundos,
una persona
											es declarada insolvente o en bancarrota.
											Para ponerlo en perspectiva,
desde que empecé a hablar,
											dos personas en este país
entraron en bancarrota.
											En el Reino Unido, Demos.org dice que 
los estadounidenses de entre 25 y 34 años
											tienen la segunda tasa más alta 
de bancarrota.
											Tienen 25 años.
											Cada uno deberíamos preguntarnos:
											""¿Por qué? ¿Por qué está pasando esto?""
											Y, en mi visión simplista, es por esto:
											Porque el dinero que están gastando 
no es real, es una abstracción.
											Y para detener esto 
en la nueva generación,
											tenemos que hacerles entender
que viven en un mundo
											donde deben tomar decisiones
monetarias reales,
											donde el dinero es mayormente una ilusión 
pero tiene consecuencias muy reales.
											Como quiero que sus niños y los míos
sean muy exitosos financieramente,
											consideren lo siguiente:
											si van a gastar dinero en los niños,
											denles una cantidad fija de dinero 
y déjenlos gastarla.
											Permítanles sentir el dinero concreto 
entre sus manos.
											Déjenlos tener éxito o fallar
con consecuencias menores
											para que más tarde en la vida,
cuando tomen decisiones mayores,
											sepan que van acompañadas 
de consecuencias importantes.
											Y para los chicos mayores, esto:
											estimen una cantidad para 
ropa escolar, víveres y cosas similares,
											denles esa cantidad,
											y cuando la hayan gastado, no hay más.
											Y aquí está la clave: ellos lo gastarán
bajo su guía discreta,
											con su asesoramiento sutil,
con su supervisión perspicaz,
											y ya sea que lo llamen mensualidad,
comisión por las tareas,
											o salario semanal,
											cada niño, a partir de los cinco años,
											debe recibir semanalmente 
una cantidad concreta de dinero
											para que sepan funcionar en una sociedad
sin dinero en efectivo como la actual.
											Es mejor enseñarles el hábito de ahorrar
											cuando tienen un poquito de dinero
											que tratar de enseñarles 
cuando ya no tienen dinero
											porque se sobrepasaron al gastar.
											Conocí a un estadounidense llamado José.
											Tenía 20 años, y estudiaba
en una universidad de EE.UU.
											Era hijo de padres nacidos en Cuba.
											A los 15 años, sus padres le dijeron:
											""José, te daremos comida, alojamiento,
											y USD 50 al mes, pero el resto 
depende de ti"".
											Le pregunté: ""¿Y cómo fue eso?""
											Dijo: ""La ropa, los artículos de aseo 
y escolares, las diversiones, la gasolina,
											todo dependía de mí.
											Estuve molesto con mis padres por un año.
											¿Pero sabes qué?
											Me di cuenta de que fue la mejor cosa 
que podrían haber hecho por mí"".
											Cuando conocí a José,
											tenía una beca completa 
en la universidad a la que asistía.
											De su trabajo a tiempo parcial, había 
ahorrado USD 20 000 en una cuenta
											durante la secundaria,
											y este chico exudaba talento financiero
y un inconfundible potencial de liderazgo.
											Mi mensaje central de hoy es este:
											no se necesita un juego de mesa 
de USD 10 000,
											ni aislar a los chicos financieramente
para hacer una diferencia.
											El primer paso es muy fácil.
											Se trata de educar a la nueva generación
para tomar decisiones en un mundo
											donde el dinero es mayormente una ilusión,
pero tiene consecuencias reales,
											y la razón por la cual esto es importante 
para nosotros, como sociedad global,
											es que la próxima generación
											heredará la economía global
que les estamos entregando,
											y que colocaremos precariamente 
sobre sus hombros.
											Les debemos la preparación 
para el éxito financiero.
											Muchas gracias.
											(Aplausos)
											Muchas gracias.
