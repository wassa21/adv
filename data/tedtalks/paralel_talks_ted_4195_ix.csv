											It’s June, just after a heavy rainfall,
											and the sky is filling with creatures 
we wouldn’t normally expect to find there.
											At first glance,
this might be a disturbing sight.
											But for the lucky males and females 
of Solenopsis invicta,
											otherwise known as fire ants, 
it’s a day of romance.

											This is the nuptial flight,
											when thousands of reproduction-capable 
male and female ants,
											called alates, 
take wing for the first and last time.
											But even for successful males 
who manage to avoid winged predators,
											this mating frenzy will prove lethal.
											And for a successfully mated female, 
her work is only beginning.

											Having secured a lifetime supply of sperm 
from her departed mate,
											our new queen must now single-handedly 
start an entire colony.
											Descending to the ground,
											she searches for a suitable spot 
to build her nest.
											Ideally, she can find somewhere 
with loose, easy-to-dig soil—
											like farmland 
already disturbed by human activity.
											Once she finds the perfect spot, 
she breaks off her wings—
											creating the stubs 
that establish her royal status.
											Then, she starts digging 
a descending tunnel ending in a chamber.
											Here the queen begins laying her eggs, 
about ten per day,
											and the first larvae hatch within a week.
											Over the next three weeks,
											the new queen relies on a separate batch 
of unfertilized eggs
											to nourish both herself and her brood,
											losing half her body weight 
in the process.
											Thankfully, after about 20 days,
											these larvae grow 
into the first generation of workers,
											ready to forage for food 
and sustain their shrunken queen.

											Her daughters 
will have to work quickly though—
											returning their mother 
to good health is urgent.
											In the surrounding area,
											dozens of neighboring queens 
are building their own ant armies.
											These colonies 
have peacefully coexisted so far,
											but once workers appear,
											a phenomenon known as brood-raiding 
begins.
											Workers from nests 
up to several meters away
											begin to steal offspring 
from our queen.
											Our colony retaliates,
											but new waves of raiders 
from even further away
											overwhelm the workers.
											Within hours, the raiders have taken 
our queen’s entire brood supply
											to the largest nearby nest—
											and the queen’s surviving daughters 
abandon her.
											Chasing her last chance of survival,
											the queen follows the raiding trail 
to the winning nest.
											She fends off other losing queens 
and the defending nest’s workers,
											fighting her way 
to the top of the brood pile.
											Her daughters help their mother succeed 
where other queens fail—
											defeating the reigning monarch, 
and usurping the brood pile.
											Eventually, 
all the remaining challengers fail,
											until only one queen— 
and one brood pile— remains.

											Now presiding over several hundred workers
in the neighborhood’s largest nest,
											our victorious queen begins 
aiding her colony in its primary goal:
											reproduction.
											For the next several years, 
the colony only produces sterile workers.
											But once their population 
exceeds about 23,000,
											it changes course.
											From now on, every spring,
											the colony will produce 
fertile alate males and females.
											The colony spawns these larger ants 
throughout the early summer,
											and returns to worker production 
in the fall.
											After heavy rainfalls, 
these alates take to the skies,
											and spread their queen’s genes 
up to a couple hundred meters downwind.

											But to contribute 
to this annual mating frenzy,
											the colony must continue to thrive 
as one massive super-organism.
											Every day, younger ants feed the queen 
and tend to the brood,
											while older workers 
forage for food and defend the nest.
											When intruders strike,
											these older warriors fend them off 
using poisonous venom.
											After rainfalls, 
the colony comes together,
											using the wet dirt to expand their nest.
											And when a disastrous flood 
drowns their home,
											the sisters band together 
into a massive living raft—
											carrying their queen to safety.

											But no matter how resilient,
											the life of a colony must come to an end.
											After about 8 years, 
our queen runs out of sperm
											and can no longer replace dying workers.
											The nest’s population dwindles, 
and eventually,
											they’re taken over 
by a neighboring colony.
											Our queen’s reign is over, 
but her genetic legacy lives on.
