											That was a song based on
numerous work songs,
											and it was arranged by Odetta,
											a hero of mine.
											And this next song, well,
											I do a lot of historical music,
											starting with the Carolina Chocolate Drops
											and continuing on in my solo endeavors.
											And I believe that knowing
your history as a musician
											is super important —
											it's important as a person,
											it's important as a country,

											So I read a lot about where
the music comes from
											and where this country comes from.
											I've been reading a lot
about the Civil War
											and about slavery.
											And it's really tough.
											You know?
											It's really tough reading.
											And so as an artist,
what I do with all that emotion,
											reading these people's stories,
											not just, ""Oh, slavery was terrible.""
											Yes, it was.
											But it's reading individual narratives
of how it was for these people.
											You know?
											Then it's like, ""Yeah,
that could've been me.""
											And it is people now. You know?
											So what you do with all that emotion
											is you've got to do something with it.
											As an artist, I write.
											So I wrote a song based on
some of those narratives that I read,
											and it's called, ""Come Love Come.""
											We're going to do it for you now.
									","
											Je lis beaucoup
sur l'origine de la musique
											et l'origine de ce pays.
											J'ai beaucoup lu
sur la guerre de Sécession
											et sur l'esclavage.
											C'est vraiment dur.
											Vous voyez ?
											C'est vraiment dur à lire.
											En tant qu'artiste,
avec toute cette émotion,
											à lire les histoires de ces gens,
											je ne commente pas juste cette atrocité.
											C'était atroce.
											C'est la lecture des récits individuels
de ce que c'était pour ces gens.
											Vous voyez ?
											Et puis ça aurait pu être moi.
											Et ce sont des gens, vous voyez ?
											Toute cette émotion,
											vous devez en faire quelque chose.
											Étant une artiste, j'écris.
											J'ai écrit une chanson basée
sur certains des récits que j'ai lus
											et elle s'appelle
« Viens mon amour viens ».
											Nous allons la jouer pour vous.

American music figures
											that most of you probably never heard of.
											If you have, I'm so happy.
											She's one of the innovators
of rock 'n' roll guitar,
											and one of the first crossover artists
from gospel to secular.
											She's an incredibly important figure,
											and I'm going to talk about her
whenever I can.
											So these are a couple of her tunes.
											And don't worry — you're going to get
your chance to sing.
									","
											Dans l’obscurité, il vous faut la lumière.
											Dans la communauté afro-américaine,
											depuis des centaines d'années,
c'est notre tâche
											de trouver comment nous relever.
											Je vais terminer avec deux morceaux
de Sœur Rosetta Tharpe,
											une personnalité influente
de la musique américaine
											dont vous n'avez pas dû entendre parler.
											Si c'est le cas, je suis contente.
											C'est une innovatrice
de la guitare rock 'n' roll
											et est parmi les premiers artistes
à mélanger gospel et séculaire.
											C'est une personnalité très importante
											j'en parlerai à chaque fois
que je le pourrai.
											Voici deux de ses morceaux.
											Pas d'inquiétude, vous aurez
l'occasion de chanter.
