oppresion and freedom.
											After over 20 years in South Africa
											we find ourselves as the black masses
											still suffering and fighting
for our freedom and humanity.
											This first song was called ""Iyeza""
which means ""medicine.""
											Medicine for our madness,
medicine for our rage.
											This song we're doing now
is called ""Zabalaza,""
											and it means ""rebel.""
											I'd like to dedicate this to the valiant
student movement in South Africa
