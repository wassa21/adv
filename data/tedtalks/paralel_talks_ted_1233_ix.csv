											I recently had the tremendous opportunity
of searching for gold
											in the vast mine of songs
released by Chess Records,
											a Chicago-based label that was really
very active in the '50s and '60s in the US
											and that music spread all over the world.
											And the songs that I'm singing tonight
											are from an album that I just put out
called, ""Playing Chess,""
											that pays homage to those songs.
											And these guys were really the innovators
of rock 'n' roll and soul and R&amp;B
											as we now know it.
