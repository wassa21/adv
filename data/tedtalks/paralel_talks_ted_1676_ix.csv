											More than a racial conversation,
we need a racial literacy

of racial threat in America.
											Key to this literacy is a forgotten truth,

represent the power

											Both of my parents were African-American.

from each other as east is from west,

											If you look at the neuroscience research

											With the help of my many colleagues
at the Racial Empowerment Collaborative,
											we use in-the-moment stress-reduction
											in several research and therapy projects.
											One project is where we use basketball
to help youth manage their emotions
											during 60-second eruptions on the court.
											Another project, with the help
of my colleagues Loretta and John Jemmott,
											we leverage the cultural style
of African-American barbershops,
											where we train black barbers
to be health educators in two areas:
											one, to safely reduce the sexual risk
in their partner relationships;
											and the other,
											to stop retaliation violence.
											The cool part is the barbers use
their cultural style
											to deliver this health education
to 18- to 24-year-old men
											while they're cutting their hair.
											Another project is where we teach teachers
											how to read, recast and resolve
stressful moments in the classroom.
											And a final project, in which we teach
parents and their children separately
											to understand their racial traumas
											before we bring them together
to problem-solve daily microaggressions.
									","
											Avec l'aide de nombre
de collègues de l'association,
											nous utilisons une réduction
du stress dans l'instant
											dans des projets de recherche
et de thérapie.
											Pour un projet, nous utilisons le basket
											pour aider les jeunes
à gérer leurs émotions
											durant des éruptions
de 60 secondes sur le terrain.
											Il y a un autre projet où, avec l'aide
de mes collègues Loretta et John Jemmott,
											nous tirons profit du style culturel
des coiffeurs afro-américains
											en entraînant les coiffeurs noirs
											à être des éducateurs de santé
dans deux domaines :
											un, pour réduire le risque sexuel
dans leurs relations conjugales ;
											deux,
											pour mettre un terme aux représailles.
											Les coiffeurs utilisent
leur style culturel
											pour délivrer cette éducation de santé
aux hommes de 18 à 24 ans
											pendant qu'ils leur coupent les cheveux.
											Dans un autre projet,
nous apprenons aux professeurs
											à lire, reformuler et résoudre
les moments stressants en classe.
											Pour le dernier projet, nous apprenons
séparément aux parents et aux enfants
											à comprendre leurs traumatismes raciaux
											avant de les réunir
pour résoudre des problèmes
											de micro-agressions quotidiennes.

											In August of 2013,
											Julian, who was eight at the time,
and I were folding laundry,
											which in and of itself
is such a rare occurrence,
											I should have known something
strange was going to happen.
											On the TV were Trayvon Martin's parents,
											and they were crying
											because of the acquittal
of George Zimmerman.
											And Julian was glued to the TV.
											He had a thousand questions,
and I was not prepared.
											He wanted to know why:
											Why would a grown man stalk
and hunt down and kill
											an unarmed 17-year-old boy?
											And I did not know what to say.
											The best thing that could
come out of my mouth was,
											""Julian, sometimes in this world,
there are people
											who look down on black and brown people
											and do not treat them —
and children, too —
											do not treat them as human.""
											He interpreted the whole situation as sad.

											A la télé, les parents
de Trayvon Martin pleuraient

											Julian était collé à la télé.
											Il avait des milliers de questions
et je n'étais pas prêt.
											Il voulait savoir pourquoi :
											pourquoi un homme adulte traquerait-il,
pourchasserait-il et tuerait-il
											un garçon non armé de 17 ans ?
											Je ne savais pas quoi dire.
											La meilleure chose
à sortir de ma bouche fut :
											« Julian, parfois dans ce monde,
il y a des gens
											qui méprisent ceux
à la peau noire et marron
											et ne les traitent pas —
les enfants aussi —
											ne les traitent pas
comme des êtres humains. »
											Il a interprété la situation

											HS: Racial socialization is not just
what parents teach their children.
											It's also how children respond
to what their parents teach.
											Is my child prepared?
											Can they recognize when a racial elephant
shows up in a room?
											Can they reduce
their tsunami interpretation
											down to a mountain-climbing adventure
											that they can engage and not run away?
											Can they make a healthy
and just decision in 60 seconds?
											Can I?
											Can you?
									","

que ce que les parents disent aux enfants.
											Ce sont aussi ce que les enfants répondent
à ce que leurs parents leur apprennent.
											Mon enfant est-il préparé ?

le problème de la race survient ?
											Peut-il réduire
son interprétation de tsunami
											à une aventure d'escalade de montagne
											à laquelle il peut s'attaquer
et ne pas fuir ?
											Peut-il prendre une décision saine
et juste en 60 secondes ?
											Le puis-je ?

											Yes, we can.
											We can build healthier
relationships around race
											if we learn to calculate, locate
communicate, breathe and exhale
											in the middle of our most
threatening moments,
											when we come face-to-face
with our lesser selves.
											If you take the centuries of racial rage
											that boils up in all of our bodies,
minds and souls —
											and anything that affects our bodies,
minds and souls affects our health —
											we could probably use
gun control for our hearts.
											I just want what all parents
want for their children
											when we're not around:
											affection and protection.
											When police and teachers see my children,
											I want them to imagine their own,
											because I believe if you see
our children as your children,
											you won't shoot them.
									","
											Oui, nous le pouvons.
											Nous pouvons établir des relations
plus saines autour de la race
											si nous apprenons à calculer, localiser,
communiquer, respirer et expirer,
											au cœur de nos moments
les plus menaçants,
											face à face avec la pire version
de nous-mêmes.
											Si vous prenez les siècles de rage raciale
											qui bouillent dans notre corps,
notre esprit et notre âme —
											tout ce qui affecte notre corps, esprit
ou âme, affecte notre santé —
											nous pourrions nous en servir
pour contrôler notre cœur.
											Je veux ce que tous les parents
veulent pour leurs enfants
											quand ils ne sont pas là :
											de l'affection et de la protection.
											Quand la police et les professeurs
voient mes enfants,
											je veux qu'ils imaginent les leurs
											car je crois qu'en voyant
nos enfants comme étant les vôtres,
											vous ne leur tirerez pas dessus.

											With racial literacy, and yes, practice,
											we can decode the racial trauma
from our stories,
											and our healing will come in the telling.
											But we must never forget
											that our cultural differences
are full of affection and protection,
											and remember always
that the lion's story will never be known
											as long as the hunter
is the one to tell it.
									","
											Avec une alphabétisation raciale

sont pleines d'affection et de protection
											et rappelez-vous que l'histoire
du lion ne sera jamais connue
											tant qu'elle sera racontée
par le chasseur.
