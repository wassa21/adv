											I was 23 years old
											when I first heard
about Reproductive Justice.
											I was working at Women with a Vision,
											where I learned that Reproductive Justice
was defined by Sister Song as:
											One: A woman's right to decide
if and when she will have a baby
											and the conditions
under which she will give birth.
											Two: A woman's right
to decide if she will not have a baby
											and her options for preventing
or ending a pregnancy.
											And three: A woman's right
to parent the children she already has
											in safe and healthy environments
											without fear of violence
											from individuals or the government.
									","
											J'avais 23 ans
											quand j'ai entendu parler
de la justice reproductive.
											Je travaillais pour un magazine féminin
											où j'ai appris que Sister Song définissait
la justice reproductive comme étant :
											une : le droit d'une femme de décider
si et quand elle aura un bébé
											et les conditions dans lesquelles
elle donnera naissance.
											Deux : le droit d'une femme de décider
si elle ne veut pas avoir de bébé
											et ses options pour éviter
ou mettre un terme à une grossesse.
											Et trois : le droit d'une femme d'être
une mère pour les enfants qu'elle a déjà
											dans des environnements sûrs et sains
											sans craindre de violence
											de la part d'individus ou du gouvernement.
									","
											Tenía 23 años
											cuando por primera vez escuché 
sobre la justicia reproductiva.
											Trabajaba en ""Woman With A Vision"",
											donde aprendí que Sister Song 
definió la justicia reproductiva como:
											Uno, el derecho de la mujer de decidir 
si quiere tener un bebé y cuándo tenerlo
											y las condiciones en las que dará a luz.
											Dos: el derecho de la mujer 
a decidir no tener un bebé
											y elegir opciones para prevenir
o interrumpir un embarazo.
											Y tres: el derecho de la mujer 
a criar los hijos que ya tiene
											en ambientes seguros y sanos
											sin miedo a la violencia
											por parte de individuos o el gobierno.

											Months later,
											when George Zimmerman
was not held responsible
											for murdering Trayvon Martin,
											I heard Sybrina Fulton,
											Trayvon Martin's mother, speak.
											Her testimony so deeply impacted me
											that I found myself constantly asking,
											what would it mean to mother
in the United Stated of America
											in this skin?
											What does motherhood really mean,
											when for so many who look like me
											it is synonymous with mourning?
											Without realizing it,
											I had begun to link
the Reproductive Justice framework
											and the Movement for Black Lives.
											As I learned more
about Reproductive Justice
											at Women With A Vision,
											and as I continued to be active
in the Movement for Black Lives,
											I found myself wanting others
to see and feel these similarities.
											I found myself asking:
											Whose job is it in times like this
											to connect ideas realities and people?

											Des mois plus tard,

si profondément
											que je me suis constamment demandé
											ce que cela signifierait d'être une mère
en Amérique dans cette peau.
											Que signifie réellement la maternité
											quand, pour tant de gens
qui me ressemblent,
											elle est synonyme de deuil ?
											Sans le réaliser,
											j'avais commencé à associer
la notion de justice reproductive
											et du mouvement pour les vies noires.
											En en apprenant plus
sur la justice reproductive
											au magazine où j'étais
											et en continuant d'être active
dans le mouvement pour les vies noires,
											j'ai voulu que les autres
voient et ressentent ces similitudes.

											Meses más tarde,
											cuando George Zimmerman

											que me encontré cuestionando 
constantemente
											qué significaría ser madre en 
los Estados Unidos de América
											con esta piel.
											¿Qué significa realmente ser madre,
											cuando para tantos que lucen como yo
											es sinónimo de estar de luto?
											Sin darme cuenta,
											he empezado a conectar el contexto 
de la justicia reproductiva

											Recently,

											les scènes sur lesquelles
elles méritent d'être.
											Puis je me suis souvenue
des mots que je venais de prononcer.
											« Dans des moments d'effroi,
											les artistes ne doivent jamais
choisir de garder le silence.
											Il n'y a pas le temps de s'apitoyer.
									","
											Recientemente,
											Toni Morrison escribió que
											en tiempos de temor,
											los artistas nunca deben elegir 
guardar silencio.
											No hay lugar para la autocompasión,
											no hay lugar para el miedo.
											Ayer, durante el ensayo,
											cuando me dijeron que debería
											""tal vez cortar la parte sobre 
Black Lives Matter de mi charla"",
											sentí temor.
											Temía que otra vez se les negara 
a nuestras historias
											los propios lugares donde 
merecen ser contadas.
											Y luego recordé las palabras 
que acababa de decir.
											En tiempos de temor,
											los artistas nunca deben elegir
guardar silencio.
											No hay lugar para la autocompasión.
