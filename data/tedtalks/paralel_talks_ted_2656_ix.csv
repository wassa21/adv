											As you've heard, when I was very young,
											I was elected to
the New Zealand Parliament.
											And at that age, you learn mostly
by listening to others' stories.
											I remember a woman
who'd been injured in a farm accident,
											and it was coming up to shearing time
											on the farm,
											and she had to be replaced by a shepherd,
											by a rousie in the woolshed,
											and of course there was still someone
needed to manage the household
											and to prepare the food
for the shearing gangs.
											And her mother came to help with that.
											But the family got
no compensation for the mother,
											because that's what mothers
and family members are supposed to do.

											One year, a company called
Gold Mines New Zealand
											applied for a prospecting license
on our beautiful Mt. Pirongia.
											It is a mountain
											full of extraordinary ecosystems,
											of verdant, virgin native forests.
											It produced oxygen, it was a carbon sink,
											it was a home for endangered species
and for pollinating species
											in the farmland around.
											And the mining company put up
this great economic prospectus
											that was about how much
money could be made
											from mining our mountain,
											about all the growth and development
											that would show in New Zealand's
budgetary forecasts,
											and we were just left with the language
											of all that we valued about our mountain.
											Fortunately, we stopped.

											a woman who had three children under five
											who was caring for her elderly parents,
											and nobody seemed to think
that at some stage
											she might actually need
some assistance with childcare,
											because she wasn't in the paid workforce.

											And there began to be a pattern
in all of these stories I was being told.
											And I started to ask enough questions
											to try and track to the core
of this pattern of values
											that was part of all of these stories.
											And I found it
											in an economic formula
called the ""gross domestic product,""
											or the GDP.
											Most of you will have heard of it.

what it actually means.

											The rules were drawn up
by Western-educated men in 1953.
											They established a boundary of production
											in drawing up these rules.
											What they were keen to measure
											was everything that involved
a market transaction.
											So on one side of the boundary,
											everything where there was
a market exchange was counted.
											It doesn't matter whether
the exchange is legal or illegal.
											Market exchange in the illegal trade
in armaments, [munitions],
											drugs, endangered species,
											trafficking of people —
											all of this is great for growth
											and it all counts.

											On the other side
of the boundary of production,
											there was this extraordinary
phrase in the rules
											that the work done by the people
they called ""nonprimary producers""
											was ""of little or no value.""
											So I thought, let's see how many
nonprimary producers we have here today.
											So in the last week or so,
											how many of you have transported
members of your household or their goods
											without payment?
											How many of you have done
a bit of cleaning, a bit of vacuuming,
											a bit of sweeping,
a bit of tidying up the kitchen?
											Yeah?
											How about going shopping
for members of the household?
											Preparing food? Cleaning up afterwards?
											Laundry? Ironing?

											All of those activities are on
the wrong side of the production boundary.
											And something that's
very important to know
											about this accounting framework:
											they call it ""accounts,""
											but there's no debit side.
											We just keep market exchanges going,
											and it's all good for growth.
											We're in Christchurch,
											where people have lived through
a devastating natural disaster
											and recovered.
											And ever since that time,
											New Zealand has been told
											our growth figures are great,
because we're rebuilding Christchurch.
											Nothing was ever lost

											because of the loss of lives,
											the loss of land,
											the loss of buildings,
											the loss of special spaces.

											Now, it might also
be becoming obvious to you

in terms of our environment.
											When we're mining it,
											when we're deforesting,
											when we're deleting our environment,
											when we're fishing out
our marine resources,
											legal or illegal,
											as long as market is exchanged,

											One of the things that you notice
about these rules —
											they are revised; 1968
they were revised, 1993, 2008 —
											is that the revisions
are mostly done by statisticians,
											and the statisticians do know
what is wrong with the data,
											but hardly any of the economists
ever stop to ask that same question.

											So, in 2019,
											the GDP is in even worse shape.
											You see, to measure GDP,
											you have to assume
that some kind of production
											or service delivery or consumption
											occurs inside a nation-state,
											and you know where that is.
											But trillions of dollars
are circling the globe
											in mini-part from our Googles,
our Facebooks, our Twitters,
											siphoned through a number of tax shelters,
											so that when we click on our computer
											and go to download some software,
											we don't know where it was produced,
											and frankly, no one knows where we are
as we're consuming it, either.
											These tax-free havens
											distort the GDP to such an extent
											that about three years ago,
											Europe looked askance at Ireland
											and said, ""We don't think
you're reporting correctly,""
											and in the next year,
their GDP went up 35 percent.

											Now, all that work that you're doing
											when you were at leisure and unproductive,
											we can measure this,
											and we can measure this
in time use surveys.
											When we look at the amount
of time that's taken
											in the unpaid sector,
											what we find is that in almost every
country where I've ever seen the data,
											it is the single largest sector
of the nation's economy.
											In the last three years, for example,
											the UK statistician has declared
											that all of that unpaid work
is the equivalent of all manufacturing
											and all retailing in the UK.
											In Australia,
											the single largest sector of Australia's
economy is unpaid childcare,
											and the second-largest sector
is all the rest of the unpaid work,
											before banking and insurance
and financial intermediation services
											clock in at the largest part
of the market sector.
											Just last year, the Premier
of the Victoria state of Australia
											declared that half of that state's GDP
											was, in fact, the value
of all the unpaid work.

											is not visible.

											So what can go in the place of GDP?
											Well, GDP has got many other problems, OK?
											We don't behave in a way that assists GDP.
											Large numbers of people around the planet
											are now using household assets —
their cars, their homes, themselves —
											for Uber, for Airbnb.
											And no, we're not supposed to use
assets from the unpaid sector
											to make money in the market sector.

											I think time use is the most important
indicator going forward.
											Every one of us has exactly
the same amount of it.
											If there are going to be critical issues
as we move forward,
											we need a solid database,
											because whatever we change
away from the GDP,
											we're going to be stuck with it
