											(Beatboxing) Yo, what up?
											My name is Tom Thum,
											and I've got to say
it's a pleasure to be back at TEDx.
											When I first stepped
upon the Sydney stage in 2013
											as a starry-eyed boy from Brisbane,
											I had no idea that I was about to deliver
the most watched TEDx presentation ever.
									","
											(Hace beatbox) Hola, ¿cómo están?
											Me llamo Tom Thum,
											y debo decir que me alegra volver a TEDx.
											Cuando subí al escenario por primera vez 
en Sídney en 2013
											dejando Brisbane lleno de ilusiones
											no sabía que la presentación que estaba a 
punto de dar sería la más vista de todas.
									","
											(Beatbox yapıyor) Hey, naber millet?
											Ben Tom Thum
											ve söylemeliyim ki tekrar 
TEDx'te olmak çok güzel.
											Brisbane'li yeni yetme birisi olarak
											2013'te Sdney'deki 
sahneye ilk çıktığım zaman
											konuşmamın en çok izlenen TEDx konuşması 
olacağı hakkında en ufak bir fikrim yoktu.

to take air from the lungs
											and then turn it into a vibrating
air column in the throat.
											If you think of it like a trumpet,
											we've got the mouthpiece —
that's the vocal folds —
											and then the horn section is the throat.
											If we took your head off,
											took a bit of your neck off
											and left you as a torso
with just your vocal folds vibrating,
											this is what you'd sound like.

— o sea, las cuerdas vocales —
											y el cuerno sería la garganta.
											Si sacáramos la cabeza,
