											Nearly 100 years ago,
											almost today,
											most women in the United States
finally won the right to vote.
											Now, it would take decades more
for women of color to earn that right,
											and we've come a long way since,
											but I would argue not nearly far enough.
											I think what women want today,
											not just only in the United States
but around the globe,
											is to no longer be an afterthought.
											We don't want to continue to try to,
like, look at the next 100 years
											and be granted, grudgingly,
small legal rights and accommodations.
											We simply want true and full equality.
											I think that women are tired
of retrofitting ourselves
											into institutions and governments
that were built by men, for men,
											and we'd rather reshape the future
on our own terms.
											I believe —

											Il y a près de 100 ans,
											presque au jour près,
											la plupart des femmes aux États-Unis
ont enfin gagné le droit de voter.
											Il allait falloir des décennies de plus
											pour que les femmes de couleur
obtiennent ce droit
											et nous avons fait beaucoup de chemin,
											mais je dirais que nous sommes loin
d'en avoir parcouru assez.
											Ce que les femmes veulent,
											pas seulement aux États-Unis
mais à travers le monde,
											c'est de ne plus être
une réflexion après coup.
											Nous ne voulons pas continuer d'essayer
de considérer les 100 prochaines années
											et que l'on nous accorde, à contrecœur,
de petits droits et arrangements légaux.
											Nous voulons simplement
une égalité réelle et complète.
											Je pense que les femmes
en ont marre de se moderniser
											pour correspondre aux institutions
et aux gouvernements
											conçus par des hommes, pour des hommes
											et nous préférerions remodeler
le futur selon nos propres termes.

											I believe what we need is a women's
political revolution for full equality
											across race, across class,
across gender identity,
											across sexual orientation,
											and yes, across political labels,
											because I believe what binds us
together as women
											is so much more profound
than what keeps up apart.
											And so I've given some thought

this women's political revolution
											and that's what I want
to talk to you about today.

cette révolution politique des femmes
											et c'est de cela dont je veux
vous parler aujourd'hui.

											So today in the United States,

took just one day off of work,
											it would cost the United States
21 billion dollars

											The point is that women

it's another story,

is worth 1000 words.

											when congressional leaders
were called over to put the final details
											into the health-care reform bill
that was to go to Congress.
											Now, one of the results of this meeting
											was that they got rid
of maternity benefits,
											which may not be that surprising,
											since no one at that table
actually would need maternity benefits.
											And unfortunately,
that's what we've learned the hard way
											in the US for women.
											If we're not at the table,
we're on the menu, right?
											And we're simply not at enough tables,
											because even though women
are the vast majority of voters
											in the United States,
											we fall far behind the rest of the world
in political representation.
									","
											Le fait est que les femmes
changent vraiment les industries,
											elles changent
les entreprises de l'intérieur.
											Mais quand il s'agit du gouvernement,
c'est une autre histoire
											et je crois qu'une image vaut mille mots.
											Voici une photographie de 2017
à la Maison-Blanche
											alors que les dirigeants du Congrès
ont été appelés pour finaliser
											le projet de réforme des soins de santé
présenté au Congrès.
											Un des résultats de cette réunion
											était de se débarrasser
des prestations de maternité,
											ce qui n'est pas si surprenant
											puisque personne à cette table n'aurait

											Malheureusement,

											Recent research is that when
they ranked all the countries,
											the United States is 104th
in women's representation in office.
											104th ...
											Right behind Indonesia.
											So is it any big surprise, then,
											considering who's making decisions,
											we're the only developed country
with no paid family leave?
											And despite all the research
and improvements we've made
											in medical care —

											So, starting November 10

											A partir du 10 novembre

											So I think the question is,
											what would it take, actually, to build
this women's political revolution?
											The good news is, actually,
it's already started.
											Because women around the globe
are demanding workplaces,
											they're demanding
educational institutions,
											they're demanding governments
											where sexism and sexual harassment
and sexual assault are neither accepted
											nor tolerated.
											Women around the world, as we know,
											are raising their hands
and saying, ""Me Too,""
											and it's a movement
that's made so much more powerful
											by the fact that women
are standing together across industries,
											from domestic workers
to celebrities in Hollywood.
											Women are marching, we're sitting in,
											we're speaking up.
											Women are challenging the status quo,
											we're busting old taboos
											and yes, we are proudly making trouble.
									","
											Je pense que la question est :
											que faudrait-il pour fonder
cette révolution politique des femmes ?
											La bonne nouvelle,
c'est qu'elle a déjà commencé.
											Car les femmes à travers le monde
exigent un lieu de travail,
											elles exigent des institutions éducatives,
											elles exigent des gouvernements
											où le sexisme, le harcèlement sexuel
et les agressions sexuelles
											ne sont ni acceptés ni tolérés.
											Les femmes à travers le monde
											lèvent la main et disent :
« Me Too », ou « Moi aussi »,
											et c'est un mouvement
rendu tellement plus fort
											par le fait que les femmes fassent
front commun dans toutes les industries,
											des employées de maison
aux célébrités hollywoodiennes.
											Les femmes manifestent, font des sit-in,
											elles s'expriment.
											Les femmes remettent
en question le statu quo,
											nous faisons éclater les vieux tabous
											et oui, nous sommes fières
de faire du bruit.

											Invest in women as candidates,
as changemakers, as leaders.
											Just as an example,
											in this last election cycle
in the United States,
											women donated 100 million dollars more
to candidates and campaigns
											than they had just two years ago,
											and a record number of women won.
											So just think about that.

											aux candidats et aux campagnes
											qu'elles ne l'ont fait il y a deux ans

											Réfléchissez à cela.

											So look, sometimes I think
that the challenges we face,
											they seem overwhelming
											and they seem like they almost
can never be solved,
											but I think the problems
that seem the most intractable
											are the ones that are most
important to work on.
											And just because it hasn't been
figured out yet doesn't mean you won't.
											After all, if women's work were easy,
											someone else would have
already been doing it, right?

											But women around the globe,
they're on the move,
											and they are taking strengths
and inspiration from each other.
											They are doing things
they never could have imagined.
											So if we could just take
the progress we have made
											in joining the workforce,
											in joining business,
											in joining the educational system,
											and actually channel that
into building true political power,
											we will reshape this century,
											because one of us can be ignored,
											two of us can be dismissed,
											but together, we're a movement,
											and we're unstoppable.
									","
											Mais les femmes à travers le monde
se mettent en mouvement
											et tirent leur force et leur inspiration
les unes des autres.
											Elles font des choses
qu'elles n'auraient jamais imaginées.
											Si nous pouvions prendre
le progrès réalisé
											en entrant sur le marché du travail,
											dans le monde des affaires,
											dans le système éducatif
											et le canaliser pour établir
un vrai pouvoir politique,
											nous allons remodeler ce siècle
											car une d'entre nous peut être ignorée,
											deux d'entre nous peuvent être écartées
											mais ensemble, nous sommes un mouvement
											et nous sommes inarrêtables.
