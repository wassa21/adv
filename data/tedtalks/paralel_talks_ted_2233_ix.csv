											As a result of my studies,
I found a thread,
											that the essence of religion
was compassion.
											That every single one
of the major world religions —
											Judaism, Islam, Christianity,
Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism ...
											they all insisted on what's often known
as the Golden Rule:
											never treat others as you
would not like to be treated yourself.
											My wish was that you would get
a panel of activists
											and together, we would craft
a charter, a brief statement
											reminding the world that this
is what religion is about.

											KA: Our nations seem
to be crumbling by the day.
											And this should make us uncomfortable.
											We've all got huge problems in our cities.
											Problems of inequity
and cruelty and violence.
											So, what can we do?
											What can we do to change things?
											Every city has to be compassionate.
											And people often ask me,
what should a compassionate city be like?
											And I said,
											""Well, a compassionate city
should be an uncomfortable city.""
											One is Louisville, Kentucky,
where the mayor, Greg Fischer,
											actually campaigned
on the idea of compassion.

											Greg Fischer: When I announced
compassion as a city value,
											it got a lot of attention.
											A city is a platform
for human potential to come alive.
											Compassion makes individuals stronger
and makes our city stronger.

											GF: So the questions then is,
how do you bring compassion to life?

the culture of your city?
											What if you could start at the beginning
of a young child's life?

											My name is Megan Clem Mattingly.
											I am the Compassionate
Schools Project teacher.
											Compassion is a very teachable thing.
											OK, I see a lot of friends
who are looking ready.
											Every CSP class begins
with calming and focusing.
											And then we have some sort
of core practice that we're doing
											whether we're talking about
self-awareness or empathy-building skills.
											We are starting at the ground level,
											we're building that foundation
for our students at age five and up,
											to be more compassionate citizens.

											MCM: Anger or frustration,
which feeling was bringing —
											Anger, I can tell. Look at your hands.
											So, before we talk about it,
can you calm yourself down?
											No? it's hard to, isn't it?
											Can you try to make your hands
look like mine?
											Look.
											Can you try to let go of that?
											Look at your face, I see a smile there.
											You're trying real hard
to hang on to that anger.

											GF: Hotel Louisville is a great example
of how to think about a whole system
											of getting a person back on track.
											So it's a shelter
for women and their families,
											but it's also an operating hotel.

											Cynthia Brown: Hotel Louisville
was not just a women's rehab facility,
											it is a workforce program.
											We run the hotel, we do all the jobs here.
											Every job that one of us has
has their own individual skills.
											It gets us a sense of responsibility,
											because we can put this
on our resumes when we leave.
											I think the compassion really comes
from the girls that are in the rehab
											because we depend on each other a lot.
											We need each other.

											GF: It lifts us all up to say,
this is the kind of city we are,
											and this is the kind of city
we aspire to be.
											And that any way we can help other cities

is what we want to do.
											It's this ripple effect;
we're not perfect as a city,
											but boy, we're working
to be better every day.

											KA: Here you have a city which
is doing great things with compassion.
											Cities and mayors are going to play
an important role
											as leaders of the future.
											I'd like to see a thousand

											that remind the rest of the world
what our duty is.
											Always treat all others
as you'd like to be treated yourself.
