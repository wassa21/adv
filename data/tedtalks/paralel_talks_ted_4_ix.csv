											Narrator: We have you here today
specifically to try and learn
											a little bit about how the brain
processes visual illusions.

											WJM: Our research focuses mostly
on perception and decision-making.
											What's out there in the world,
the brain has no idea,
											but it's trying to do its best
to figure it out.
											And even though that process
is pretty sophisticated,
											sometimes it goes wrong.

											The first step is that
light enters your eyes.
											Just from the table
or from the coffee cup,
											you get an image in your eye,
											but the hard work only starts after that.
											Very often, the incoming signals
are not complete and they're not perfect,
											and your brain has to make sense of them.
											There are cases where
this inference process goes wrong,
											and that's when you have
a visual illusion.

											N: Can visual illusions be proof
that our brains make similar mistakes
											about other things,
											for example, in the areas
of politics, economics or religion?

											WJM: I probably don't want to go that far,
but there's a metaphor there.
											It's good to consider
other points of view.
											It's good to consider your own certainty.
											Illusions are merely a window
in this kind of processing
											that's going on all the time,
											where our brain builds beliefs
of what might be happening in the world.

											N: What if we looked at
a different illusion every day
											as a reminder that our brains can be wrong
											about the things
we are most certain about?

											WJM: As a scientist,
I wouldn't be able to tell you
											that that's going to work,
											but it sounds like an interesting idea.
											You should try it
and let me know how it goes.
