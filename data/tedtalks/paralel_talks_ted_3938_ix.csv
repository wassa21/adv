											I started life as a fashion designer,
											working closely with textile designers
and fabric suppliers.
											But today, I can no longer see
or talk to my new collaborators,
											because they're in the soil
beneath our feet,
											on the shelves of our supermarkets
											and in the beer I'm going to drink
when I finish this talk.
											I'm talking about microbes
											and designing with life.

											Fifteen years ago,
											I completely changed
both what I worked with
											and how I worked
											after a revelatory collaboration
with a biologist.
											Our project gave me
a different perspective on life,
											introducing a whole new
world of possibility
											around how we can design and make things.
											I discovered a radical
manufacturing proposition:
											biofabrication.
											Literally, fabricating with biology.

											What does that mean?
											Well, instead of processing
plants, animals or oil
											to make consumer materials,
											we might grow materials directly
with living organisms.
											In what many are terming
""the Fourth Industrial Revolution,""
											we're thinking about the new factories
as being living cells.
											Bacteria, algae, fungi, yeast:
											our latest design tools
include those of biotechnology.

											My own journey in biofabrication
											started with a project
called ""Biocouture.""
											The provocation was that instead
of growing a plant, like cotton,
											in a field over several months,
											we could use microbes to grow
a similar cellulose material in a lab
											in a few days.
											Using a certain species of bacteria
in a nutrient-rich liquid,
											we fermented threads of cellulose
											that self-organized
into a sheet of fabric.
											I dried the fabric I had grown
											and cut and sewed it
into a range of garments, shoes and bags.
											In other words,
in one lab we grew materials
											and turned them into a range of products
											in a matter of days.
											And this is in contrast
to currents methods of fabric production,
											where a plant is grown,
											just the cotton part is harvested,
											processed into a yarn,
											woven into a fabric
											and then potentially shipped across oceans
											before being cut and sewn into a garment.
											All of that can take months.

											So these prototypes indicated a field
											offering significant
resource efficiencies.
											From reducing the water,
energy and chemistry needed
											in the production of a material,
											through to generating zero waste,
											we grew fabrics to finished form —
											if you like, ""biological
additive manufacture.""

											Through biofabrication,
											I had replaced many
intensive man-made steps
											with one biological step.
											And as I engaged with this living system,
											it transformed my design thinking.
											Here was biology,
with no intervention from me
											other than designing initial
conditions for growth,
											efficiently producing a useful,
sustainable material.

											So now I can't help but see all materials
through the lens of biofabrication.
											In fact, there's a growing
global community of innovators
											rethinking materials with biology.
											Multiple companies are now
growing mushroom materials,
											but not literally mushrooms —
											using mycelium, which is
the root system of fungi,
											to bind together agricultural byproducts.
											It's a process that's been
described as ""nature's glue.""
											A common way to do this
is to take a 3-D mold,
											fill it with a waste crop
like corn stalks or hemp,
											add water,
											wait a few days for the mycelium
to grow throughout,
											remove the mold,
											and you're left with a grown 3-D form.

											Incredibly, we can grow
all kinds of structures
											using living organisms,
											from foams that can replace
plastics in footwear,
											to leather-like materials without animals.
											Furniture, flooring — all
are currently being prototyped.
											Fungi are able to grow materials
that are naturally fire retardant,
											without any chemicals.
											They're naturally hydrophobic,
											meaning they won't absorb water.
											They have higher melt
temperatures than plastics.
											Polystyrene can take thousands
of years to degrade.
											Mushroom packaging materials
											can be naturally composted
in your back garden
											in as little as 30 days.
											Living organisms are transforming waste
											into cost-competitive,
performance-matching materials
											that can start to replace plastics
											and other CO2-emitting materials.

											And once we start growing materials
with living organisms,
											it starts to make previous methods
of manufacture seem illogical.
											Take the humble house brick.
											The cement industry generates
around eight percent
											of global CO2 emissions.
											That's more than all the planes
and ships each year.
											The cement process
requires materials to be fired in a kiln
											at over 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
											Compare this to bioMASON.
											They use a soil microbe
to transform loose aggregates,
											like sand or crushed stone,
											into a biofabricated, or biocement, brick.
											Their process happens at room temperature,
											in just a couple of days.
											Think: hydroponics for bricks.
											An irrigation system
feeds nutrient-rich water
											to trays of bricks
											that have been inoculated with bacteria.
											The bacteria produce crystals
											that form around each grain of sand,
											locking together all the loose particles
											to form a solid brick.
											We can now grow construction materials
											in the elegant way nature does,
											just like a coral reef.
											And these biofabricated bricks
are nearly three times stronger
											than a concrete block.
											And in stark contrast
to traditional cement production,
											they store more carbon than they make.
											So if we could replace
the 1.2 trillion fired bricks
											that are made each year
											with biofabricated bricks,
											we could reduce CO2 emissions
											by 800 million tons every year.

											Beyond growing materials
with living organisms,
											we're even starting to design products
											that encourage their growth.
											And this comes from the realization
											that the very thing we've been trying
to marginalize — life —
											might actually be
our greatest collaborator.
											To that end, we've been
exploring all the ways
											that we can grow healthy microbes
in our own ecosystems.
											A great example of this is architects
											who are imagining the skin of a building
											to function like the bark of a tree.
											But not as a cosmetic green layer.
											They're designing architectural barks
											as hosts for evolving ecologies.
											These surface structures
are designed to invite life in.
											And if we applied the same energy
we currently do suppressing forms of life
											towards cultivating life,
											we'd turn the negative image
of the urban jungle
											into one that literally embodies
a thriving, living ecosystem.
											By actively encouraging surface
interactions with healthy microbes,
											we could improve passive climate control,
											stormwater management
											and even reduce CO2 emissions
											by lowering the energy
used to heat or cool our buildings.

											It's one that moves away
from the exploitation
											of nonrenewable resources
											to working with the original,
renewable life.
											Instead of designing out life,
											we're designing with it and for it.
											Packaging, fashion, footwear,
furniture, construction —
											biofabricated products can be grown
close to centers of demand,
											with local resources, less land, energy,
											and even harnessing
industrial waste streams.

											It used to be that the tools
of biotechnology
											were the preserve of powerful,
											multinational chemical
and biotech companies.
											In the last century,
we expected material innovation
											to come from the likes
of DuPont, Dow, BASF.
											But this 21st-century material revolution
is being led by start-ups
											with small teams and limited capital.
											And by the way, not all their founders
have science degrees.
											They include artists,
architects and designers.
											Over a billion dollars
has already been invested
											in start-ups biofabricating
consumer products.

											I don't think we have a choice
but to biofabricate our future.
											From the jacket you're wearing

											If materials can't be recycled
